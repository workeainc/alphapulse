Its proprietary language model and big data infrastructure can ingest real-time and historical data across equities, crypto, FX, futures, options and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A phased rollout of Capitalise.ai\u2019s functionality within <a href=\"https://pro.kraken.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kraken Pro</a> is expected to begin later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-unlocking-the-power-of-natural-language-trading\"><strong>Unlocking the power of natural-language trading</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Pro platform has evolved, making full use of its advanced features has increasingly required both technical skill and deep trading expertise. Capitalise.ai removes that barrier, enabling clients of all backgrounds to design, test and automate complex strategies using simple, everyday language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By integrating Capitalise.ai\u2019s technology into Kraken Pro, users will soon be able to automate sophisticated strategies across digital and traditional asset classes without writing a single line of code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis acquisition gives Kraken Pro clients a powerful new way to act on ideas in real time: testing, optimizing, and executing bespoke strategies with unprecedented speed and confidence,\u201d said Shannon Kurtas, Kraken Head of Exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCapitalise.ai\u2019s technology transforms how people interact with financial data, breaking down barriers that have long kept scalable, advanced strategies in the hands of a few. This is a major leap forward in democratizing access to pro-grade trading tools.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-coming-soon-proven-innovation-at-kraken-scale\"><strong>Coming soon: Proven innovation, at Kraken scale</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Capitalise.ai technology has been deployed by a number of TradFi brokers and exchanges with compelling results, proving to be one of the most engaging automation tools in the retail and institutional space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capitalise.ai\u2019s co-founders \u2013 CEO Amir Shiovich and CPO Shahar Rabin \u2013 along with key product and engineering talent, will join Kraken and continue to innovate within the Kraken Pro business unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https://pro.kraken.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline-block; padding: 12px 32px; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 90px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #5D45DC;\" target=\"_blank\">Explore Kraken Pro</a></div>\n<div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/news/capitalise-ai\">Announcing the acquisition of Capitalise.ai, bringing no-code trading automation to Kraken Pro</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com\">Kraken Blog</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Strategy (MSTR) fell to as low as $326 on Wednesday, trading about 4% below the 200-Day Moving Average (DMA) of $340, a key level markets watch for trading ideas. </p><p>The indicator is a widely used technical measure that smooths out price data over roughly nine months of trading, helping investors identify long-term trends. When a stock trades above its 200-DMA, it is generally seen as being in an uptrend, while trading below it may signal potential weakness or a shift in momentum. Because of its role as a key support or resistance level, the 200-DMA is closely watched by both traders and long-term investors.</p><p>In recent years, the 200-DMA has been a notable level of support for MSTR. </p><p>For instance, in April 2025, during the so-called \u201cTrump tariff tantrum,\u201d the stock tested this level before rebounding. A similar pattern emerged during the summer of 2024, when MSTR once again found a floor around the 200-DMA before resuming its upward trajectory.</p><p>Whether the current dip below this technical threshold proves temporary or signals a more sustained downturn will likely depend on both bitcoin\u2019s price action and broader market sentiment.</p><img alt=\"MSTR 200 day moving average (TradingView)\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/342546129a237f9d5b8064f2caa84971ef83b2e8-1651x998.png?auto=format\" title=\"MSTR 200 day moving average (TradingView)\" /><h2>Chanos notches a win</h2><p>Famed short-seller James Chanos <a href=\"https://x.com/MenthorQpro/status/1957109837717725475\">has been publicly bearish</a> on Strategy for a number of weeks, saying he&#x27;s opened up a sizable bet against the Michael Saylor-led company by shorting MSTR against a long in bitcoin.</p><p>Of late, the trade has been looking like a winner, with MSTR lower by 21% over the past month compared to bitcoin&#x27;s very modest 3.5% decline.</p><p>Market technician <a href=\"https://x.com/JC_ParetsX/status/1958166677054537835\">J.C. Parets noted on Wednesday</a> that the ratio between MSTR and IBIT (BlackRock&#x27;s spot bitcoin ETF) has now fallen to a five-month low. \"This one is accelerating quickly,\" said Parets.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The \"great wealth transfer\" is underway, and it could be one of the biggest drivers of crypto adoption in history, crypto friendly Xapo Bank said in a report Wednesday.</p><p>Over the next decade, trillions of dollars will move from baby boomers to younger heirs. In the U.S. alone, an estimated $10.6 trillion will change hands by 2030, with trillions more in Europe and Asia, the report said. </p><p>Unlike their parents, these heirs are far more inclined toward digital assets, setting the stage for bitcoin (BTC) to become a core component of inherited wealth.</p><p>Xapo Bank analysts noted that between $160 billion and $225 billion could flow into bitcoin over the next two decades, as a result of this generational shift, translating into an additional $20 million to $28 million in daily demand.</p><p>Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, decentralization and potential as an inflation hedge make it an attractive store of value for this next generation, the report noted. </p><p>Still, inheriting crypto is more complicated than inheriting a brokerage account. Keys can be lost, unregulated exchanges remain risky, and legal frameworks are inconsistent.</p><p>The Gibraltar-based firm&#x27;s &#x27;Bitcoin Beneficiaries&#x27; program is designed to tackle inheritance challenges head-on, offering secure custody, legally recognized transfer mechanisms and regulatory clarity for heirs. </p><p>The bank says its wealthiest clients are already adopting the service, signaling that sophisticated holders see inheritance planning as essential to protecting their digital legacies.</p><p>For bitcoin holders, securing an inheritance strategy is no longer optional, it\u2019s the only way to ensure their assets survive the generational handoff, the report added.</p><p><strong><em>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/11/crypto-bank-xapo-snags-european-broker-license-will-offer-stocks-like-apple\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Crypto Bank Xapo Snags European Broker License, Will Offer Stocks Like Apple</span></a></em></strong></p>",

SoFi&#x27;s remittance product, which is expected to roll out later this year, will allow users to send U.S. dollars through the SoFi app, with recipients receiving local currency deposits abroad, using Lightspark&#x27;s Universal Money Address (UMA). Lightspark\u2019s UMA provides access to a global payment rail designed for speed and scale. Transfers will display upfront exchange rates and fees, addressing longstanding pain points in traditional remittance services. The launch follows SoFi\u2019s reentry into crypto, after halting services in 2023 during its transition to a national bank. Earlier this year, it revealed plans to offer international remittances through blockchain and stablecoins and allow users to invest in crypto.\u00a0\u2014 <em>Jamie Crawley </em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/19/sofi-taps-bitcoin-lightning-network-for-global-remittances-with-lightspark\">Read more</a>.</p><p><strong>BITLAYER ENTERS SOLANA WITH YBTC: </strong>Bitcoin DeFi project Bitlayer has partnered with Kamino Finance and Orca to bring its bitcoin-backed token, YBTC, to the Solana ecosystem. This integration is intended to combine Bitlayer&#x27;s security with Solana&#x27;s speed and scalability, aligning with Bitlayer&#x27;s goal of expanding the Bitcoin DeFi sector. It will provide bitcoin holders with native BTC exposure and yield opportunities, said Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer. YBTC, pegged 1:1 with BTC, is central to Bitlayer&#x27;s BitVM bridge, which is designed for trust-minimized bitcoin transfers by eliminating centralized intermediaries. The token serves as a direct representation of users&#x27; locked BTC within the Bitlayer ecosystem, enabling seamless interoperability between Bitcoin and decentralized finance applications. By holding YBTC, Solana users can maximize yields through Kamino\u2019s institutional-grade earn vaults, which provide auto-compounding and optimized BTC-denominated returns, helping assets grow effortlessly.\u00a0\u2014 <em>Omkar Godbole</em> <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/19/bitlayer-s-ybtc-enters-solana-as-the-defi-project-partners-with-kamino-finance-orca\">Read more</a>.</p><p><strong>VALANTIS ACQUIRES stHYPE: </strong>Valantis, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, has acquired Staked Hype (stHYPE), the second-largest liquid staking token (LST) on Hyperliquid.

Following the deal, stHYPE\u2019s operations, development, and scaling will be managed by Valantis Labs.

The company says it will also use Dogecoin\u2019s DogeOS layer 2 to stake in DeFi products, aiming to boost miner returns beyond standard rewards. \u2014 <em>Sam Reynolds </em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/20/trump-family-expands-crypto-bets-as-thumzup-pivots-into-dogecoin-mining\">Read more</a>.</li></ul><div style=\"display: none;\">Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option</div><h3>Regulatory and Policy</h3><ul><li>The crypto industry is mounting a counteroffensive against Wall Street bankers\u2019 bid to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/wall-street-joins-consumer-advocates-to-call-for-edit-to-genius-act-on-stablecoins\">rewrite the U.S.\u2019 new stablecoin law</a>, arguing that attempts to roll back core provisions of the GENIUS Act would tilt the field toward traditional banks. In a letter to Senate Banking Committee leaders dated Aug. 19, the Crypto Council for Innovation and the Blockchain Association urged lawmakers to reject proposals from the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute and state banking groups that called for stripping out Section 16(d) of the law and banning yield programs offered by affiliates of stablecoin issuers. Section 16(d) allows subsidiaries of state-chartered institutions to conduct money transmission across state lines in support of stablecoin issuer activities, ensuring holders can redeem their tokens nationwide without needing separate state licenses. Banking groups warned earlier this month that allowing state-chartered, uninsured institutions to issue stablecoins and operate nationwide would amount to regulatory arbitrage, bypassing state licensing regimes. \u2014 <em>Sam Reynolds </em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/20/crypto-lobby-pushes-back-against-bank-effort-to-rewrite-stablecoin-law\">Read More</a></li><li>The U.S. Federal Reserve&#x27;s newest vice chair who supervises Wall Street banking, Michelle Bowman, made <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250819a.htm\">a crypto speech on Tuesday</a> that could have been uttered by one of the industry&#x27;s own policy wonks, advocating that banks get behind the digital assets surge and that the Fed give the sector rules that won&#x27;t get in crypto&#x27;s way. <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/08/18/jackson-hole-weighs-on-digital-assets-crypto-daybook-americas\">At the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium</a>, Bowman warned banks that don&#x27;t embrace the shift toward crypto \"will play a diminished role in the financial system more broadly,\" and she further underlined what&#x27;s already been an obvious change in crypto sentiment from U.S. banking regulators. \"Your industry has already experienced significant frictions with bank regulators applying unclear standards, conflicting guidance, and inconsistent regulatory interpretations,\" she said. \"We need a clear, strategic regulatory framework that will facilitate the adoption of new technology, recognizing that in some cases, it may be inadequate and inappropriate to apply existing regulatory guidance to address emerging tech.\" \u2014 <em>Jesse Hamilton </em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/19/u-s-federal-reserve-s-new-supervision-chief-sold-on-bringing-crypto-to-finance\">Read more</a>.</li></ul><div style=\"display: none;\">Unknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option</div><h3>Calendar</h3><ul><li>Sept. 22-28: <a href=\"https://koreablockchainweek.com/\">Korea Blockchain Week</a>, Seoul</li><li>Oct. 1-2: <a href=\"https://www.token2049.com/?ref=fintechlabs.com\">Token2049</a>, Singapore</li><li>Oct. 13-15: <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/event/digital-asset-summit-2025-london\">Digital Asset Summit</a>, London</li><li>Oct. 16-17: <a href=\"https://eblockchainconvention.com/european-blockchain-convention-11/?utm_term=digital%20asset%20summit&amp;utm_campaign=EBC10+-+Sales&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=7795475099&amp;hsa_cam=22659648651&amp;hsa_grp=182504557604&amp;hsa_ad=757796101592&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-756664361403&amp;hsa_kw=digital%20asset%20summit&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22659648651&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC9Vgcv7kVMuyv2WsnlQO_HO0LVCM&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7fzDBhA7EiwAOqJkh2gtq80AObKLUiIUyrjD8D4ao26d7C6xEBz-WXUHM7ly_psif2sn7BoCNfIQAvD_BwE\">European Blockchain Convention</a>, Barcelona</li><li>Nov. 17-22: <a href=\"https://devconnect.org/\">Devconnect</a>, Buenos Aires</li><li>Dec. 11-13: <a href=\"https://solana.com/breakpoint\">Solana Breakpoint</a>, Abu Dhabi</li><li>Feb. 10-12, 2026: <a href=\"https://consensus-hongkong.coindesk.com/\">Consensus</a>, Hong Kong</li><li>May 5-7, 2026: <a href=\"https://consensus.coindesk.com/\">Consensus</a>, Miami</li></ul>",

Ether balances on centralized exchanges continue to decline, signaling a shift of supply back on-chain. This dynamic could be amplifying the latest leg higher, creating a squeeze-like effect, the report added.</p><p>While the rally has been sharp, the bank&#x27;s analysts caution it isn\u2019t purely technical. On-chain activity has picked up, reinforcing the move with stronger fundamentals. Combined with a macro backdrop that resembles a \u201cgoldilocks\u201d environment, neither too hot nor too cold, ether&#x27;s resurgence could have legs, particularly with supportive regulatory signals and bullish narratives in play.</p><p><strong><em>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/ether-led-rally-pushed-crypto-market-cap-to-usd3-7t-in-july-jpmorgan\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ether-Led Rally Pushed Crypto Market Cap to $3.7T in July: JPMorgan</span></a></em></strong></p>",

In partnership with Backed, Kraken is collaborating with the TRON DAO to integrate xStocks with the TRON blockchain, opening up new opportunities for tokenized equities exposure across one of the world\u2019s most active and scalable blockchain ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRON\u2019s high throughput, low-cost infrastructure and global footprint make it a natural fit for the next phase of xStocks\u2019 evolution. In the coming weeks, eligible Kraken clients will be able to deposit and withdraw xStocks directly through the TRON network, enhancing accessibility and optionality for traders and investors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-collaboration-with-backed-and-tron-dao\">Collaboration with Backed and TRON DAO</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the integration, Backed will deploy xStocks on TRON as TRC-20 tokens, maintaining full 1:1 backing for each tokenized asset listed on Kraken\u2019s platform. The TRON DAO will also work closely with ecosystem partners to integrate xStocks more broadly, enabling tokenized equities to reach a wider audience and ecosystem of builders and users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arjun Sethi, Kraken co-CEO</strong>: \u201cExpanding xStocks to three blockchains in under 60 days shows what\u2019s possible when you design for openness from the start. TRON\u2019s scale, low fees, and global reach make it a strong addition to our multi-chain architecture for tokenized equities. Every xStock is fully collateralized, on-chain, and verifiable in real time. This integration moves us closer to a world where equities trade like the internet works &#8212; permissionless, borderless, and interoperable across ecosystems.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis collaboration highlights how TRON\u2019s decentralized network can bring tokenized equities into a more open, transparent, and accessible environment,\u201d said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. \u201cTokenized equities represent a natural evolution for crypto, bridging traditional markets with blockchain. As demand for popular equities meets a global base of previously excluded users, we\u2019ll see a more efficient, flexible, and accessible market.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Levi, Backed co-Founder</strong>: \u201cxStocks\u2019 expansion to TRON is a natural step, aligning the blockchain\u2019s dominance in stablecoin transfers with tokenized equities, crypto\u2019s next major use case. Millions around the world already use TRON\u2019s low-cost, high-throughput infrastructure for tokenized US dollars. Now, they\u2019ll be able to do the same with tokenized equities.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-driving-global-access-to-capital-markets\">Driving global access to capital markets</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extending xStocks support to the TRON blockchain is a continuation of our mission to bring traditional equities on-chain and extend access to capital markets for communities around the world. xStocks are currently available to Kraken clients in over 140 countries, with support coming for additional countries in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since inception, xStocks has been designed to meet users where they are, offering a transparent, open, and borderless pathway to U.S. capital markets. Launched in late June, xStocks have already surpassed $2.5 billion in combined CEX and DEX volume, underscoring market appetite for this new asset class and a powerful indicator of its long term growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29592\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.kraken.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xStocks_WEBLaunch_Blog_Hero.jpg?resize=1024%2C467&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration with TRON marks another important milestone in the growth of xStocks and builds on the momentum from recent announcements involving BNB Chain, as well as our initial launch with Solana, Kraken\u2019s blockchain launch partner for xStocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our multi-chain strategy reflects a core belief: tokenized equities should be open, permissionless, and interoperable across ecosystems, giving users the freedom to access markets on the chains they trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the weeks ahead, we will continue working with Backed to bring xStocks to additional high-performance blockchains, expanding access for Kraken clients across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.kraken.com/xstocks\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: inline-block; padding: 12px 32px; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; line-height: 24px; border-radius: 90px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #5D45DC;\" target=\"_blank\">Explore xStocks on Kraken</a></div>\n<div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>xStocks are not available in the U.S. or to U.S. persons.

The CoinDesk 80 Index (CD80) of next-largest tokens fell 1.4%.</p><p>Traders are looking to the release of the minutes from the last Federal Reserve policy meeting, scheduled for later Wednesday, while emphasizing the importance of tracking the Treasury General Account, the U.S. government&#x27;s account with the Fed. The Treasury is in the process of rebuilding the TGA balance, which may pose a risk to asset prices.</p><p>In key news, Point72 Asset Management and ExodusPoint Capital Management disclosed equity stakes in crypto payments firm Alt5 Sigma on Monday, according to Bloomberg.</p><p></p><h2>Derivatives Positioning</h2><ul><li>Leveraged crypto futures bets worth $448 million have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Most were longs, which means significant bullish leverage has been cleared from the market.</li><li>Open interest in BTC, DOGE and XRP has declined, indicating that the price drop has yet to trigger a surge in new bearish bets.</li><li>Meanwhile, LINK, HYPE and SUI have seen increases in open interest, while OI has held flat in ETH, according to data source Coinglass.</li><li>Perpetual funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies continue to remain mildly positive, indicating a bias towards long positions. The opposite is the case for ADA and XMR.</li><li>Solana futures open interest on CME remains elevated near record highs above 4.6 million SOL, with the annualized three-month premium rising to 16% from 12% last week. The uptick indicates bullish capital inflows.</li><li>BTC open interest is beginning to recover, now at 145.76K BTC, the highest since late July. Premium remains below 10%. In ETH&#x27;s case, the premium again faded the spike above 10%, with open interest approaching the 2 million ETH mark.</li><li>On Deribit, short-dated (one-week) and near-dated (coming months) BTC and ETH puts continue to trade at a premium to calls, reflecting concerns about downside risks.</li><li>Flows over the OTC network Paradigm featured increased activity in put options tied to bitcoin and ether, with activity across outrights, spreads, and calendar spread strategies. </li></ul><h2>Token Talk</h2><ul><li>Solana token issuance platform <strong>Pump.fun</strong> has crossed $800.6 million in lifetime revenue, <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/4903533/8118614\">Dune data</a> shows, mostly from its 1% swap fee, with daily intake averaging over $1 million. This puts it among a small list of platforms earning high revenues in the crypto space.</li><li>Pump originally collected fees when tokens \u201cgraduated\u201d to Raydium, but now earns from its in-house DEX, PumpSwap. The model has proven sticky despite competition.</li><li>LetsBonk briefly overtook Pump in graduated tokens last month, driven by its Raydium LaunchLab integration and Bonk community push, but lost ground as top memecoin deployers migrated back to Pump.</li><li>Pump\u2019s token ICO last month raised $600 million in 12 minutes, with the platform now running buybacks above market price to stabilize trading. This is indicative of how the launchpad has become an asset in itself.</li><li>In contrast, LetsBonk revenue has collapsed to under $30,000 a day from around $1 million earlier this month, showing the volatility of memecoin platforms competing for flow.</li><li>New entrant Token Mill is trying to stand out with a \u201cKing of the Mill\u201d mechanism in which fees are used to buy and burn the highest-volume token every 30 minutes. The aim is to gamify volatility as a growth loop.</li><li>Solana, meanwhile, lost its crown as the dominant memecoin chain to Coinbase&#x27;s Base, which has tied token issuance into decentralized social media via Zora. On Monday, Base hosted nearly 58,000 new memecoins versus 33,000 on Solana.</li></ul>",

      "title": "The Era of Real-World Assets DeFi Looping is Here",
      "content": "<p>While much of crypto chases volatility, the most capital-efficient allocations of 2025 are hiding in plain sight: looping. These structured strategies quietly recycle billions through the same assets, transforming modest yield spreads into outsized, risk-adjusted returns. In essence, they are the on-chain counterpart to TradFi\u2019s repo and carry trades, now enhanced by tokenized real-world assets.</p><h3><strong>What is DeFi looping and how does it work?</strong></h3><p>DeFi looping is a yield amplification mechanism built on correlated collateral and debt. The essence of looping is yield-bearing assets \u2014 tokens that grow in value over time. Good examples include liquid staking tokens like Lido\u2019s wstETH, synthetic dollars like Ethena\u2019s sUSDe or tokenized private credit funds like Hamilton Lane\u2019s SCOPE. The process begins by depositing such a yield-bearing asset, e.g. weETH, into a money market account, borrowing a closely related asset against it, e.g. ETH, allocating the borrowed amount back into the yield-bearing version, e.g. staking ETH on EtherFi and then redepositing it as collateral \u2014 that is one full loop. One of the most widely adopted looping structures is weETH (EtherFi\u2019s wrapped staking ether) paired with ETH on lending platforms such as Spark.</p><p><strong>Asset design:</strong> weETH accrues staking rewards, so one unit gradually becomes worth more ETH over time. Here, at EtherFi protocol launch 1 weETH equalled 1 ETH. Now, <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/app/token/weETH_FUNDAMENTAL/\">it equals 1.0744 ETH</a>.</p><img alt=\"Chart: weETH / ETH price appreciation over time via liquid restaking yield accrual\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/830f8348eebd83efdae5c5c45bdbc7a511dbb220-1600x699.png?auto=format\" title=\"weETH / ETH price appreciation over time via liquid restaking yield accrual\" /><p><em>weETH / ETH price appreciation over time via liquid restaking yield accrual, Source: <a href=\"https://app.redstone.finance/app/token/weETH_FUNDAMENTAL/\">RedStone</a></em></p><p><strong>Risk correlation:</strong> If weETH yields ~3 percent annually and ETH borrow rates are 2.5 percent, each loop captures a 0.5 percent spread. With 90 percent loan-to-value ratio and 10 loops, that spread compounds, potentially increasing returns to roughly 7.5 percent annually.</p><h3><strong>Market size in 2025 and growth potential</strong></h3><p>Contango\u2019s Q3 2024 estimates <a href=\"https://medium.com/contango-xyz/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-tango-launch-db4a689191a5\">suggested that 20 to 30 percent of the $40 billion-plus locked in money markets and collateralized debt positions was attributable to looping strategies. </a>This implied $12\u201315 billion in open interest, or roughly 2\u20133 percent of total DeFi TVL at the time.</p><p>Today, that scale is likely much larger: Aave alone holds close to $60 billion in TVL. Given that trading volumes in leverage-based strategies typically exceed open interest by a factor of ten, annual transaction volume from looping may already surpass $100 billion.</p><h3><strong>Beyond ETH: stable-yield assets</strong></h3><p>Looping can also be applied to asset pairs that are not necessarily crypto native. A practical example is sACRED / USDC looping on Morpho. Here, a token representing a tokenized private credit fund (Apollo\u2019s ACRED via sACRED vault) is deposited to borrow USDC, which is then converted into sACRED and redeposited. While the yield profile is designed to be predictable, it depends on the performance of the underlying private credit portfolio and is not as inherently stable as ETH staking rewards.</p><img alt=\"Chart: RWA looping strategy on Morpho secured by RedStone price feeds\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80d9513e9b84f6a6a9a5383187c211a75de51803-1600x900.png?auto=format\" title=\"RWA looping strategy on Morpho secured by RedStone price feeds\" /><p><em>RWA looping strategy on Morpho secured by RedStone price feeds, Source: <a href=\"https://www.gauntlet.xyz/resources/enhancing-rwa-returns-with-gauntlets-optimization-engine\">Gauntlet</a>.</em></p><h3><strong>Future directions: tokenized funds as loop collateral</strong></h3><p>Institutions are bringing RWAs on-chain partly because looping can amplify returns with transparent, modelable risks and auditable parameters. Likely growth lanes include:</p><ul><li><strong>Private credit</strong> vehicles, e.g., Hamilton Lane\u2019s SCOPE, made available via Securitize with daily on-chain NAV delivered by RedStone, and on-demand redemptions, positioned for steady monthly yield per issuer materials.</li><li><strong>Cash-and-carry strategies</strong> like Spiko C&amp;C, capturing predictable term premia.</li><li><strong>Reinsurance-linked securities</strong>, like MembersCap MCM Fund I, historically have been associated with low default rates and consistent payouts.</li></ul><h3><strong>Why this matters for institutions</strong></h3><p>Looping enables more efficient use of capital by turning yield-generating positions into repeatable, collateralizable instruments. The risk\u2013return profile is similar to traditional fixed-income and money market desks, but here it is delivered with 24/7 liquidity, transparent collateralization metrics and automated position management.</p><p>It is one of DeFi\u2019s most battle-tested strategies, with clear appeal for traditional finance: higher yields within a framework of transparent, well-defined and actively monitored risks. As tokenized RWAs scale, looping is poised to become a foundational building block in on-chain portfolio construction, further narrowing the gap between traditional and decentralized finance.</p>",

      "content": "<p>XLM slipped into a pronounced bearish trajectory over the past 24 hours, trading between $0.39 and $0.40 and breaking below key support levels. The token\u2019s volatility intensified during the final trading hours of Aug. 20, when prices fell from $0.40 to $0.39, marking a decisive breach of support that had previously provided buying momentum. The move signals continued pressure on the asset despite its attempts to consolidate around the $0.40 threshold.</p><p>Trading data revealed heightened distribution activity, with turnover hitting 45.04 million during the 13:00 session\u2014well above the 24-hour average. The spike in volume underscores notable institutional participation in the sell-off, amplifying downward momentum. XLM\u2019s failure to hold above resistance levels and its breach of multiple intraday supports point to bearish conditions likely persisting in the near term.</p><p>The weakness in XLM comes despite constructive ecosystem news. The Stellar Development Foundation recently committed capital to U.K.-based tokenization firm Archax, underscoring its long-term growth strategy. Still, broader market conditions weighed heavily, with bitcoin holding near $113,500 while altcoins faced corrective pressure, leaving XLM exposed to continued downside risk.</p><img alt=\"XLM/USD (TradingView)\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/732c9d9f3d249217a7bbfcf3c447d57e3c9443f9-2726x1373.png?auto=format\" title=\"XLM/USD (TradingView)\" /><h5><strong>Technical Indicators Signal Continued Fragility</strong></h5><ul><li>Price breached decisively beneath the established $0.39 support level that had previously provided accumulation interest.</li><li>Volume surged dramatically during steepest decline phases, with 4.92 million recorded at 14:17\u2014the highest single-minute reading.</li><li>Failed to establish meaningful support above the $0.39 psychological level throughout the session.</li><li>Persistent lower peaks pattern indicates accelerating downward momentum remains intact.</li><li>Zero volume recorded at 14:20 suggests potential capitulation amongst market participants.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> <em>Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ethics\">our standards</a>.

      "content": "<p>Emails race across the globe in milliseconds, yet money still moves at a crawl. It can take days to make payments, especially cross-border \u2014 longer over weekends or holidays. The result? Trillions of dollars are trapped where they can\u2019t earn yield.</p><p>This inefficiency is more than an inconvenience \u2014 it is a systemic drag. For companies and financial institutions, delayed access to liquidity means higher costs, constrained working capital and a structural handicap in a world that expects everything in real real-time.</p><h3>Stablecoins as the catalyst</h3><p>The advent of stablecoins proved that money could move at the speed of the internet. Today, <a href=\"https://visaonchainanalytics.com/\">trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions</a> settle instantly on blockchain rails, with stablecoins providing the dollar liquidity that powers crypto markets, payments and remittances. But stablecoins themselves only solve half the problem.</p><img alt=\"Chart: Average Stablecoin Supply: All Stablecoins\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a690ac4a034b16fc27e2ae78d1f36244c24d2ff-1600x1077.png?auto=format\" title=\"Average Stablecoin Supply: All Stablecoins\" /><p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://visaonchainanalytics.com/\">https://visaonchainanalytics.com/</a></em></p><p>They provide speed, not yield. Stablecoin balances, in aggregate <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/stablecoins\">hundreds of billions of dollars</a>, typically earn nothing. Contrast that with tokenized treasury<strong> </strong>assets and money market funds, which are low-risk, yield-bearing instruments that pay the risk-free rate. The challenge is that subscriptions and redemptions into and out of these products still run on asynchronous, often T+2 timelines locking out investable capital needed in the immediate term.</p><h3>Convergence and composability</h3><p>The industry now stands on the cusp of convergence. The world\u2019s leading asset managers now offer tokenized money market funds, with BlackRock\u2019s BUIDL for example <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/assets/BUIDL\">topping $2 billion</a> in assets under management.</p><img alt=\"Chart: Real World Assets BUIDL\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b52a63cc4927eca05d17c746c6f313d2f0fd9008-1458x712.png?auto=format\" title=\"Real World Assets BUIDL\" /><p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/assets/BUIDL\">https://app.rwa.xyz/assets/BUIDL</a></em></p><p>These tokenized funds can transfer and settle instantly, including atomically, against other tokenized instruments like stablecoins. As stablecoin activity increases, so do cash and treasury management needs for which tokenized<strong> </strong>treasuries are the optimal solution.</p><p>What\u2019s missing is the connective tissue. Without neutral infrastructure to enable atomic, 24/7 swaps between stablecoins and tokenized treasuries<strong>,</strong> we are only digitizing old constraints. The true breakthrough comes when institutions can hold risk-free assets and instantly convert them to cash at any hour, without intermediaries, delays or price slippage.</p><h3>The stakes</h3><p>The stakes are enormous. In the U.S. alone, non-interest-bearing bank deposits total nearly $4.0 trillion. If even a fraction were swept into tokenized treasuries and made instantly convertible to stablecoins, it would unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in yield while preserving full liquidity. That is not a marginal efficiency \u2014 it is a structural shift in global finance.</p><p>Critically, this future requires open, neutral and compliant infrastructure. Proprietary walled gardens may deliver efficiency for one institution, but systemic benefits only emerge when incentives align across issuers, asset managers, custodians and investors. Just as global payment networks required interoperable standards, tokenized markets need shared rails for liquidity.</p><h3>The path forward</h3><p>The liquidity gap is not a technical inevitability. The tools exist: tokenized risk-free assets, programmable money and smart contracts capable of enforcing trustless, instant settlement. What is needed now is urgency \u2014 by institutions, technologists and policymakers \u2014 to bridge the gap.</p><p>The future of finance is not merely faster payments. It is a world where capital is never idle, where the trade-off between liquidity and yield disappears and where the foundations of financial markets are rebuilt for an always-on, global economy.</p><p>That future is closer than most realize. Those who embrace it will define the next era of financial markets; those who hesitate will be left behind.</p>",

      "content": "<p>By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)</p><p>Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have recovered slightly from late Tuesday lows, though both CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 80 indexes are lower over 24 hours, signaling a broad market weakness. Among the top 100 coins, only OKB and LINK have gained more than 3%.</p><p>The analyst community remains squarely focused on Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#x27;s speech at Jackson Hole later this week. </p><p>\"The recent sell\u2011off suggests that short\u2011term positioning remains fragile,\" Singapore-based QCP Capital said. \"Risk assets may be vulnerable to further swings if Powell strikes a hawkish tone or if upcoming labor or inflation data surprise to the upside.\" </p><p>Powell&#x27;s speech will come after publication of the minutes of the Fed&#x27;s July meeting, due later today. </p><p>The latest decline in BTC has been marked by profit-taking by short-term holders, or wallets with a history of owning coins for less than 155 days, according to CryptoQuant. The last time this occurred, in January, the bitcoin rally lost momentum near $110,000, eventually leading to a deep sell-off in March and early April.</p><p>Here&#x27;s another sign of investor disquiet: Spot bitcoin and ether ETFs registered almost $1 billion in total net outflows on Tuesday.</p><p>\"At this stage, the market broadly expects cuts, so much of that is already priced in,\" Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, said in an email, referring to U.S. interest rates. \"If Powell delivers exactly what\u2019s anticipated, crypto could see sideways-to-slightly-bearish action, a classic &#x27;sell the news&#x27; dynamic.\" </p><p>Sondergaard said markets will likely rally if Powell signals deeper or faster-than-expected rate cuts.

This puts it among a small list of platforms earning high revenues in the crypto space.</li><li>Pump originally collected fees when tokens \u201cgraduated\u201d to Raydium, but now earns from its in-house DEX, PumpSwap. The model has proven sticky despite competition.</li><li>LetsBonk briefly overtook Pump in graduated tokens last month, driven by its Raydium LaunchLab integration and Bonk community push, but lost ground as top memecoin deployers migrated back to Pump.</li><li>Pump\u2019s token ICO last month raised $600 million in 12 minutes, with the platform now running buybacks above market price to stabilize trading. This is indicative of how the launchpad has become an asset in itself.</li><li>In contrast, LetsBonk revenue has collapsed to under $30,000 a day from around $1 million earlier this month, showing the volatility of memecoin platforms competing for flow.</li><li>New entrant Token Mill is trying to stand out with a \u201cKing of the Mill\u201d mechanism in which fees are used to buy and burn the highest-volume token every 30 minutes. The aim is to gamify volatility as a growth loop.</li><li>Solana, meanwhile, lost its crown as the dominant memecoin chain to Coinbase&#x27;s Base, which has tied token issuance into decentralized social media via Zora. On Monday, Base hosted nearly 58,000 new memecoins versus 33,000 on Solana.</li></ul><h2><strong>Derivatives Positioning</strong></h2><ul><li>Leveraged crypto futures bets worth $448 million have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Most were longs, which means significant bullish leverage has been cleared from the market.</li><li>Open interest in BTC, DOGE and XRP has declined, indicating that the price drop has yet to trigger a surge in new bearish bets.</li><li>Meanwhile, LINK, HYPE and SUI have seen increases in open interest, while OI has held flat in ETH, according to data source Coinglass.</li><li>Perpetual funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies continue to remain mildly positive, indicating a bias towards long positions. The opposite is the case for ADA and XMR.</li><li>Solana futures open interest on CME remains elevated near record highs above 4.6 million SOL, with the annualized three-month premium rising to 16% from 12% last week. The uptick indicates bullish capital inflows.</li><li>BTC open interest is beginning to recover, now at 145.76K BTC, the highest since late July. Premium remains below 10%. In ETH&#x27;s case, the premium again faded the spike above 10%, with open interest approaching the 2 million ETH mark.</li><li>On Deribit, short-dated (one-week) and near-dated (coming months) BTC and ETH puts continue to trade at a premium to calls, reflecting concerns about downside risks.</li><li>Flows over the OTC network Paradigm featured increased activity in put options tied to bitcoin and ether, with activity across outrights, spreads, and calendar spread strategies.  </li></ul><h2><strong>Market Movements</strong></h2><ul><li>BTC is up 0.4% from 4 p.m. ET Tuesday at $113,757.49 (24hrs: -1.53%)</li><li>ETH is up 1.55% at $4,217.10 (24hrs: -1.62%)</li><li>CoinDesk 20 is up 1.06% at 3,983.85 (24hrs: -2.26%)</li><li>Ether CESR Composite Staking Rate is up 2 bps at 2.94%</li><li>BTC funding rate is at 0.0022% (2.4276% annualized) on Binance</li></ul><img alt=\"CD20 (Aug. 20 2025) (CoinDesk)\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d4b7aee70db99369ea0bc0daa0f0cdb35445a75-1400x400.png?auto=format\" title=\"CD20 (Aug. 20 2025) (CoinDesk)\" /><ul><li>DXY is unchanged at 98.29</li><li>Gold futures are up 0.29% at $3,368.50</li><li>Silver futures are down 0.70% at $37.07</li><li>Nikkei 225 closed down 1.51% at 42,888.55</li><li>Hang Seng closed up 0.17% at 25,165.94</li><li>FTSE is up 0.17% at 9,204.66</li><li>Euro Stoxx 50 is unchanged at 5,483.55</li><li>DJIA closed on Tuesday unchanged at 44,922.27</li><li>S&amp;P 500 closed down 0.59% at 6,411.37</li><li>Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.46% at 21,314.95</li><li>S&amp;P/TSX Composite closed down 0.35% at 27,823.88</li><li>S&amp;P 40 Latin America closed down 2.02% at 2,637.60</li><li>U.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is down 0.7 bps at 4.295%</li><li>E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.14% at 6,423.50</li><li>E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are down 0.18% at 23,427.50</li><li>E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are down 0.18% at 44,919.00</li></ul><h2><strong>Bitcoin Stats</strong></h2><ul><li>BTC Dominance: 59.8% (+0.48%)</li><li>Ether-bitcoin ratio: 0.0371 (2.74%)</li><li>Hashrate (seven-day moving average): 962 EH/s</li><li>Hashprice (spot): $55.71</li><li>Total fees: 3.27 BTC / $374,274</li><li>CME Futures Open Interest: 145,760 BTC</li><li>BTC priced in gold: 34.2 oz.</li><li>BTC vs gold market cap: 9.68%</li></ul><h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2><img alt=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken have joined issuers and freelance investigators to share real-time information about bad actors, potentially offering an answer to several government efforts to clamp down on costly abuses, TRM announced on Wednesday.</p><p>As U.S. regulators and Congress actively write legislation and new rulebooks to remedy what&#x27;s arguably the industry&#x27;s worst reputational challenge \u2014 anti-money laundering controls \u2014 TRM <a href=\"https://www.trmlabs.com/about/ari-redbord\">Global Head of Policy Ari Redbord</a> said the bad guys are getting \"faster and faster.\"</p><p>\"We need this ecosystem to be locked down, and we need it to be locked down in real time,\" he told CoinDesk in an interview.</p><p></p><p>As long as North Korean hackers can rip off more than $1 billion and launder it faster than the industry can respond, the crypto ecosystem is in trouble, Redbord said.

The system is supposed to quickly highlight addresses connected to threats and trigger alerts to block bad actors from cashing out illicit assets from scams, frauds, hacks and criminal activity.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no program like Beacon Network,\u201d said Valerie-Leila Jaber, global head of anti-money laundering at Coinbase, in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a true early-warning system that helps us identify and freeze illicit assets so law enforcement can recover them.\"</p><p>And Binance Chief Compliance Officer Noah Perlman added in his own statement that \u201cBeacon Network further enables private and public sector collaboration to ensure that we continue to lower crime on the blockchain,\" which he said is one of the \"most powerful tools\" for fighting financial crime.</p><p>The network&#x27;s inaugural membership features the prominent exchanges and also includes such names as Robinhood, Ripple, Crypto.com, OKX, Poloniex, Anchorage Digital and payments firms PayPal and Stripe.</p><p></p><p>The list of involved companies is extensive and represents the vast majority of global crypto activity, though missing from the current list are leading stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle. And while TRM assures that most of the key law enforcement entities in the U.S. and around the world are participating, the company said it&#x27;s unable to name them just yet, apart from the Australian Federal Police.</p><p></p><p>There&#x27;s some precedence in the realm of traditional finance (TradFi) for <a href=\"https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/winning-aml-intelligence-war-public-private-partnerships\">public-private intelligence sharing about bad actors</a>, including at the Treasury Department&#x27;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which runs the FinCEN Exchange for trading information.</p><h2>Automated</h2><p>The crypto sector&#x27;s project doesn&#x27;t have a dedicated staff beyond the compliance and investigative personnel already at the involved companies, led by <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/12/fbi-crypto-veteran-chris-wong-joins-trm-labs-to-bolster-fight-against-illicit-finance\">TRM&#x27;s Chris Wong, an ex-FBI crypto investigator</a>. The network will rely on automation for round-the-clock alerts and transaction delays, which will be followed up by human investigators. The automation is necessary, Redbord said, because the bad actors seek to strike when they&#x27;re least likely to be spotted.</p><p>\"They don&#x27;t sleep, and they know exactly when we are sleeping,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>President Donald Trump has directed his administration to make crypto a top policy priority, and it recently <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/30/u-s-bitcoin-reserve-plans-still-elusive-as-white-house-touts-crypto-report\">issued a report and recommendations</a> on how to tackle that task, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Digital-Assets-Report-EO14178.pdf\">including a directive</a> \"encouraging domestic and cross-border information sharing, greater participation in sharing programs by digital asset financial institutions and improved information sharing between digital asset and traditional financial institutions.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senate_banking_committee_digital_asset_market_structure_legislation_discussion_draft.pdf\">current draft of a U.S. Senate bill</a> to regulate the crypto markets includes a section on illicit finance that also considers a path for agencies to \"securely share information about potential illicit finance violations and threats and emerging risks.\" And the recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act spurred the U.S. Treasury Department to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/18/u-s-treasury-department-starts-work-on-genius-gathering-views-on-illicit-activity\">open a comment period this week</a> encouraging the public to submit new ideas for addressing illicit crypto usage.</p><p>\"This is absolutely the answer to how we can do anti-money laundering and illicit finance investigations way better in crypto,\" Redbord said.</p><p>He said the network will also delve into artificial intelligence to analyze so-called \"pig butchering\" networks and criminal cartels to potentially be able to anticipate their strategies. And it&#x27;ll tap independent crypto sleuths such as <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/12/10/zach-xbt-master-sleuth-of-crypto\">ZachXBT</a> to raise their own flags.</p><p></p><p>\"There&#x27;s no ZachXBT for TradFi,\" he said.</p><p><br /><strong><em>UPDATE (August 20, 2025, 15:59 UTC):</em></strong>\u00a0<em>Adds Binance comment.</em></p>",

The prediction is notable because Armstrong rarely offers public price targets.</p><p>He isn\u2019t alone in expecting such a surge. Jack Dorsey, who ran X (formerly Twitter) until 2021 and co-founded payments firm Block (formerly Square), has also <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/10/former-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-go-beyond-1-million-in-2030\">said</a> bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030 and likely move higher beyond that milestone.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest revised its long-term outlook last month, raising its decade-end projection to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-cryptocurrency-buy-soars-084500584.html\">as high as $3.8 million</a>, citing increased institutional adoption as the main driver.</p><p>The optimism comes at a time when bitcoin has been setting records. The token is trading at $114,383, up 22% this year, after touching a new all-time high above $124,000 last week. The rally has strengthened arguments that bitcoin is consolidating its role as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold.</p><p>Some investors see major moves happening sooner. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP1ri3uns5o\">on CNBC on Aug. 19</a> that bitcoin could climb to between $180,000 and $200,000 within the next five months, adding that even that outlook may prove conservative.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss said they&#x27;re spending $21 million to continue the crypto policy momentum led by Republican lawmakers, countering a wider industry effort that&#x27;s carefully supporting politicians from both major parties.</p><p></p><p>The U.S. congressional midterm elections are approaching next year, and they promise an intense political clash that could leave President Donald Trump without the Republican control of Congress that&#x27;s helped him push crypto policy past the finish line. The brothers are giving to the Digital Freedom Fund political action committee to support GOP candidates, they said on Wednesday.</p><p></p><p>The contribution made in bitcoin (BTC) \"will identify and support champions of President Trump\u2019s crypto agenda in primary races and the midterm elections,\" Tyler Winklevoss <a href=\"https://x.com/tyler/status/1958188871377715683\">said in a post</a> on social media site X. If Democrats prevail in the midterms, as opposition parties often do in the middle of a presidential term, Winklevoss said they&#x27;ll get in the way of the Trump agenda.</p><p></p><p>\"We know from their past behavior that they will resort to whatever bad faith tactics and tricks they can think of (e.g., bogus <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/federal-impeachment/donald-trump\">impeachments</a>, lawfare, etc.) to try to derail the President,\" he wrote.</p><p></p><p>The brothers who run the Gemini crypto exchange and have become a fixture at White House crypto events and have been publicly praised by Trump, but their endorsement of Republicans runs afoul of the industry&#x27;s wider insistence that crypto policy is bipartisan and that politicians from both parties should be supported as long as they favor the sector.</p><p></p><p>In last year&#x27;s consequential congressional elections, the crypto industry erected an unprecedented tower of campaign cash in the Fairshake PAC and its affiliates, outspending other industries and even rivaling the big party-led PACs. The binge of campaign spending resulted in dozens of political victories that helped pad the industry&#x27;s level of support in the current Congress, which has moved rapidly to support digital assets initiatives \u2014 most notably the recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.</p><p></p><p>Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican who now chairs the Senate Banking Committee, thanked the industry for unseating former Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who previously ran the committee, on Tuesday at SALT Wyoming.</p><p></p><p>Fairshake, which has <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/15/with-usd25m-boost-from-coinbase-crypto-sector-s-fairshake-pac-has-usd141m-for-elections\">already amassed $141 million</a> for the next congressional elections after a recent $25 million bump from Coinbase, has split its allegiances deliberately between the parties. The industry has long pushed the talking point that its aims are nonpartisan, and Fairshake&#x27;s affiliates sought to underline that position by supporting both Democrat and Republican candidates who are willing to champion crypto bills.</p><p></p><p>The super PAC favored by the Winklevoss brothers was formed last month, according to <a href=\"https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/006/202507119762765006/202507119762765006.pdf\">Federal Election Commission filings</a>, and hasn&#x27;t yet disclosed its donor activity. It&#x27;s set up to spend money independently, meaning the campaigns it weighs into can&#x27;t have any direct involvement with the PAC&#x27;s spending decisions. That super PAC structure also lets it spend unlimited amounts, such as the tens of millions the industry expended in places like Ohio and California last year.</p><p></p><p>The Winklevosses are pursuing U.S. crypto market structure oversight that \"avoids the pitfalls of overregulation, bloated licensing regimes, and increased red tape that only serves to choke off innovation, grow the Regulatory Industrial Complex, and empower the swamp,\" Tyler wrote.</p><p>This marks a second recent development in which the men behind Gemini are going their own way from the bulk of their industry. Tyler Winklevoss stood up as a major critic of President Trump&#x27;s nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brian Quintenz. All of the leading crypto lobbying groups <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/20/crypto-world-petitions-trump-to-push-quintenz-s-cftc-nomination-in-ongoing-saga\">sent a letter to Trump</a> on Wednesday in vigorous support of Quintenz, who used to be a policy executive at a16z.</p>",

      "title": "New Solana Launchpad, Token Mill, Bets Traders (Mostly) Care Only About Price Pumps",
      "content": "<p>An upcoming token launchpad on Solana plans to drive usership and volumes to its platform by focusing on one thing it says matters most to microcap traders: Token prices going up.</p><p>Put fair launches, creator fees and community-friendly features in the backseat. Token Mill, which launches on Thursday at 16:00 UTC, comes with a design that doesn\u2019t try to be fairer or cheaper. It instead focuses on the volatility of tokens when they are issued, giving traders a reason to use the service and drive fees for the platform in doing so.</p><p>Token Mill comes from the team behind Avalanche-focused Joe and Mantle-focused Merchant Moe. In 2021, Trader Joe was among the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) by volume and mindshare, but has taken a hit in user base after a general migration of liquidity and users away from Avalanche in favor of Solana and newer ecosystems, such as Base.</p><p>Solana\u2019s Pump.fun, the leader of token issuance platforms, has been nearly untouchable since its inception in early 2024. The platform\u2019s stripped-down model \u2014 instant token creation, immediate liquidity, and a flat 1% fee \u2014 generated an estimated $800 million in annual revenue and became the cycle\u2019s killer app.</p><p>Competitors like Bonk.fun, BagsApp, and HeavenDex tried to win market share with revenue share schemes and buyback promises, but each faded after a brief surge.</p><p>At the center of Token Mill is a mechanic called King of the Mill. Tokens are divided into three market-cap tiers \u2014 Bronze ($50,000\u2013$250,000), Silver ($250,000\u2013$1 million) and Gold ($1 million\u2013$10 million). Every 30 minutes, tokens in each tier battle for the crown, with the winner decided by trading volume in the final minutes of the round.</p><p>The twist is that platform fees from that round are used to buy and burn the winning token, creating a feedback loop of visibility and price spikes.</p><p>The pitch is that one big runner can trigger a chain of smaller ones. Each race attracts more traders chasing the crown, each crown generates new fees, and each buy-and-burn sets the stage for the next pump. In theory, the wheel never stops turning.</p><p>\u201cThe nature of this flywheel also means one big runner is enough to generate a dozen smaller ones, creating an ecosystem where everyone eats,\u201d founder @cryptofishx wrote on X. \u201cTrickle down economics.\u201d</p><p>Token Mill also adds its own spin on bonding curves. Rather than forcing a token to migrate midway through its lifecycle, the platform combines two Uniswap v3-style pools into a single curve: one that runs until 80% of the supply is minted, and another that activates afterward to mimic a graduation phase.</p><p>The aim is to carry tokens from launch to maturity without interruption</p><p>The question is whether any of this can dent Pump.fun\u2019s dominance. But Token Mill is betting that if the volatility loop works as intended, it can carve out space in an ecosystem where every trader is hunting the next runner.</p><p>\u201cEvery 30 minutes, this cycle resets meaning there\u2019s always another opportunity for a runner to emerge. The more tokens compete, the more volume flows, the stronger the pumps, and the faster the flywheel spins,\u201d Token Mill\u2019s announcement read.</p><p>But Solana\u2019s trenches have seen plenty of experiments come and go. Whether this flywheel spins long enough to matter will be tested the moment the first crowns are claimed.</p>",

      "content": "<p>After President Donald Trump&#x27;s administration stepped in to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/28/crypto-s-future-top-u-s-watchdog-stymied-again-on-necessary-vote-for-confirmation\">delay the confirmation</a> of his own pick to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a mostly united crypto industry is now stepping out to cheer on the nominee, Brian Quintenz, sending the president a letter urging a quick approval.</p><p></p><p>The confirmation of the former CFTC commissioner as the regulatory agency&#x27;s new head \u2014 and likely future leading voice in overseeing the U.S. crypto markets \u2014 had been stymied at the second-to-last procedural hurdle when the White House asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to halt its vote to forward Quintenz&#x27;s nomination to a final floor vote.</p><p></p><p>That unexplained move \u2014 preceded by vigorous opposition against his candidacy from Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss \u2014 cast a shadow over Quintenz&#x27;s status, though the White House reportedly backpedaled with a quick, public assurance that Trump&#x27;s pick was still in favor.</p><p></p><p>In the interim, people familiar with the situation said Quintenz has been in direct contact with crypto insiders about their support. And weeks after his confirmation hiccup, as the Senate continues its summer break, a coalition of the largest and widest-reaching crypto associations \u2014 including the Crypto Council for Innovation, Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund \u2014 sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging his \"prompt\" confirmation.</p><p></p><p>\"Mr. Quintenz brings unmatched expertise and foresight to the challenges and opportunities of digital asset regulation, strengthened by his extensive private sector experience,\" they wrote of Quintenz, who served as <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/team/brian-quintenz/\">head of policy</a> for a16z Crypto after his CFTC stint.\"He is, quite simply, the right person at the right time to lead the CFTC,\" the letter concluded.</p><p></p><p>That runs counter to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/01/gemini-s-tyler-winklevoss-says-trump-cftc-pick-quintenz-has-disqualifying-views\">sentiments from Winklevoss</a>, who decried Quintenz&#x27;s ongoing ties to prediction market firm Kalshi and what Winklevoss characterized as attempts from Quintenz to influence the CFTC on the company&#x27;s behalf. The Gemini CEO also criticized the former CFTC commissioner&#x27;s views on software developer liability and his support for increased funding for the agency as it takes on crypto tasks.</p><p></p><p>But industry insiders recognize the leadership crisis looming at the CFTC, where Acting Chairman Caroline Pham is the only Republican member and has been talking about leaving. The agency&#x27;s only other commissioner, Kristin Johnson, is a Democrat who has also said she&#x27;s exiting soon. If Quintenz remains in a holding pattern, the regulator that stands to be elevated to lead crypto oversight could be left without any commissioners.</p><p></p><p>The Trump administration didn&#x27;t explain its hesitancy on Quintenz, nor has it nominated any other people to fill the empty seats on the five-member commission.</p><p></p><p>Quintenz declined to comment on his confirmation situation.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, congressional legislation that&#x27;s passed the House and is still being negotiated in the Senate would set up the CFTC as the primary regulator over the spot markets for crypto commodities \u2014 including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other leading tokens. That could elevate its eventual importance beyond the Securities and Exchange Commission in the realm of crypto trading, and if the bill passes Congress, the future law would head to the CFTC to be written into regulations.</p><p><strong><em>Read More: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/01/gemini-s-tyler-winklevoss-says-trump-cftc-pick-quintenz-has-disqualifying-views\">Gemini&#x27;s Tyler Winklevoss Says Trump CFTC Pick Quintenz Has &#x27;Disqualifying&#x27; Views</a></em></strong></p>",

      "title": "How Two Bitcoiners 'Tripped' Into Opaque BTC Treasuries Market and Built Massive Information Hub",
      "content": "<p>Tim Kotzman sat down in a New York studio in September 2024 to record a podcast, something he saw as little more than an experiment. The first few episodes drew almost no attention.</p><p>Kotzman had no background in journalism, and his only prior podcast experience was appearing on a friend\u2019s show to discuss his private placement fund.</p><p>The turning point came a few weeks later, when he interviewed Ryan McGinnis of the Quant Bros \u2014 a podcast often seen as the earliest outlet dissecting the bitcoin investment strategy of a company called <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/18/michael-saylor-s-strategy-added-usd51m-of-bitcoin-last-week\">MicroStrategy (MSTR)</a>. That episode about the company now renamed Strategy, released in early October, racked up 50,000 impressions within half a day and showed Kotzman the potential of his format.</p><p>The sudden spike was a turning point. </p><p>What began as a hobby quickly evolved into \"Bitcoin Treasuries,\" a media and events platform Tim now runs with Ed Juline, who previously held roles at Strategy and MARA Digital Holdings (MARA). Together, they are building a space where corporations, investors and service providers can access information that, until recently, was fragmented or opaque.</p><h2>Closing the Information Gap</h2><p>The Quant Bros podcast had already highlighted a key shift in the bitcoin landscape: the information asymmetry around corporate bitcoin treasuries. </p><p>The idea behind these treasury companies is simple: Buy bitcoin in the open market and hold it as a reserve on the balance sheet. However, there are many nuances related to the process, and the pace at which treasury companies pop up can be overwhelming for investors.   </p><p>The duo realized early on that while Strategy\u2019s (and other subsequent treasury companies&#x27;) disclosures were public, few outlets contextualized them for a wider audience. </p><p>In traditional finance and even in crypto, media companies cover earnings, balance sheets, and macro events. But with bitcoin treasury companies, what was missing was clear explanation of their metrics, valuation, and strategic approach.</p><p>Kotzman and Juline saw the opportunity and built their business around it.</p><p>As Juline put it, \u201cIn bitcoin, you have new players every day, and no clear way to know who to trust. That\u2019s the gap we\u2019re trying to fill.\u201d</p><h2>The AI angle</h2><p>Their approach mirrors bitcoin\u2019s own grassroots trajectory. Just as the largest cryptocurrency spread among the unbanked and early adopters through word of mouth, their work has grown organically through social media, building reach and influence one connection at a time.</p><p>Rather than launching with mainstream coverage, Bitcoin Treasuries grew from retail interest amplified by social media. Recent shows have attracted millions of viewers across X and YouTube, underscoring how quickly digital distribution can scale conversations.</p><p>Distributing and sorting through such a large amount of information isn&#x27;t easy. That&#x27;s where artificial intelligence (AI) came in. </p><p>\u201cIn one digital conference, I interviewed 42 people in 21 hours,\u201d Kotzman said. To make sure the interviews don&#x27;t go stale, Kotzman had to move fast, using AI. </p><p>\u201cAI tools helped us cut and share highlights almost instantly. That\u2019s what takes a conversation from a few hundred people to hundreds of thousands globally.\u201d</p><h2>Reimagining Events</h2><p>The duo also holds events to feed the appetite for information about  bitcoin treasuries. Just don&#x27;t call them conferences. </p><p>Their first in-person event, named \"<a href=\"https://lu.ma/z176rgsb\">Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference</a>,\" will be held in New York on Sept. 17.</p><p>Headlined by Strategy\u2019s Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the architect of the Tyson Corner, Virginia-based company&#x27;s bitcoin buying policy, the event is structured as a town hall rather than a stage of panels. \u201cNo slides, no canned speeches,\u201d Juline said. \u201cIt\u2019s about letting the audience challenge thought leaders directly.\u201d</p><p>According to the duo, interest has been global, with attendees registering from Australia, Dubai, Mexico, Switzerland and the U.K.</p><p>For Kotzman and Juline, this is proof of concept. \u201cBitcoin is international by nature,\u201d Kotzman noted. \u201cOur job is to connect that community and get useful information into the right hands.\u201d</p><h2>A lasting role</h2><p>Neither sees Bitcoin Treasuries as a short-term play. </p><p>Advisory work has become an extension of their media presence, linking mid-sized firms with investment banks, custody providers, lawyers, and partners they otherwise might not find. \u201cBig institutions can call Saylor,\u201d Juline said. \u201cSmaller ones can\u2019t. That\u2019s where we come in.\u201d</p><p>The bigger scope, though, is about distribution. The combination of social media algorithms, AI-driven content production, and a growing appetite for bitcoin knowledge has allowed the two enthusiasts to become essential middlemen to build something lasting in less than a year.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like we tripped into this,\u201d Kotzman said. \u201cBut really, it shows how powerful these new tools are. If you hit the right message at the right moment, the whole world can tune in overnight.\u201d</p>",

      "content": "<p>Bitcoin is trading almost $11,000 below its Aug. 14 record, according to CoinDesk data, but FalconX\u2019s head of research says the market\u2019s internal structure still looks \u201cextremely bullish.\u201d</p><p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/dlawant/status/1958212567106715956\">a post on X</a> on Wednesday, analyst David Lawant pointed to what happens in bitcoin\u2019s order book \u2014 the live record of buy and sell offers on exchanges \u2014 when the price pulls back slightly from highs. </p><p>He explained that after these small dips, sell orders quickly disappear and buy orders take over, a dynamic he described as the order book \u201cflipping\u201d from the sell side to the bid side.</p><p>In plain terms, Lawant is saying that sellers are not sticking around to push the market down after modest declines. Instead, strong demand steps in almost immediately, and buyers crowd out sellers. </p><p>That pattern suggests long-term players with deeper pockets \u2014 such as institutions and well-capitalized funds \u2014 are using brief downturns as buying opportunities. Rather than signaling weakness, the absence of sustained selling indicates confidence in bitcoin\u2019s longer-term trajectory.</p><img alt=\"FalconX Research chart showing bitcoin orderbook skew flipping to buyers after dips\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e36b82154c1d9f90f7d7db2bd5ad2d90d4783e94-809x359.png?auto=format\" title=\"FalconX Research: BTC Orderbook Skew Flips Bullish After Dips\" /><p>The chart Lawant shared reinforces this interpretation. It shows periods where bitcoin slipped slightly from record levels, only for buy orders to quickly surge ahead of sell orders. </p><p>This repeated shift toward the bid side is a hallmark of a bullish market structure, since it demonstrates that demand is waiting in the wings to absorb any supply that comes to market. For traders, the takeaway is that bitcoin\u2019s resilience after dips points to strong underlying support.</p><p>While bitcoin is still below its Aug. 14 peak of $124,481, the pattern highlighted by Lawant \u2014 sellers vanishing quickly and buyers reasserting control \u2014 continues to underpin bullish sentiment among analysts who see dips as opportunities rather than warning signs.</p><p><strong>Technical Analysis Highlights</strong></p><ul><li>According to CoinDesk Research&#x27;s technical analysis data model, between Aug. 19, 17:00 UTC and Aug. 20, 16:00 UTC, bitcoin fluctuated within a $1,899.78 range, trading between a low of $112,437.99 and a high of $114,337.77.</li><li>Around 13:00 UTC on Aug. 20, the price fell to $112,652.09 amid liquidation pressure before staging a strong rebound.</li><li>The recovery was supported by high trading activity: 14,643 BTC changed hands, compared to a 24-hour average of 9,356 BTC.</li><li>This surge established $112,400\u2013$112,650 as a key volume-backed support corridor.</li><li>In the final hour of the analysis period (15:47\u201316:46 UTC), bitcoin rose from $113,863.05 to $114,302.43 before closing at $113,983.06.</li><li>The rally broke through resistance at $113,500, $113,650 and $114,000, aided by elevated volumes of 250+ BTC per minute, signaling the start of a short-term uptrend.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong>\u00a0<em>Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to</em>\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ethics\">our standards</a>.

      "content": "<p><strong><em>This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.</em></strong></p><p>Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are attempting to establish an interim low around $113,000, but the effort appears weak in terms of both price and volume. So far, the bounce has been barely notable, with upside capped above $114,000. Additionally, volumes have stayed low relative to what we observed during the early Tuesday drop, as seen on the hourly chart.</p><img alt=\"BTC's hourly chart. (TradingView)\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f7184bf48ab7dcce87d1a480fba10727d9ce5c6-2854x1402.png?auto=format\" title=\"BTC's hourly chart. (TradingView)\" /><p>The weak bounce is consistent with bearish momentum signals, as the 50-, 100-, and 200-hour simple moving averages (SMAs) are aligned in descending order and trending downward.</p><p>On the daily chart, prices have convincingly broken below the rising trendline support, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Both the longer-term MACD histogram (50,100,9) and the more commonly used MACD (12,26,0) are showing increasing negative momentum,\u00a0with deeper bars below the zero line.</p><img alt=\"BTC's daily chart.

(TradingView)\" /><p>Therefore, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a continued move lower. The first level of support is $11,982, from which the market turned higher on Aug. 3. The 100-day SMA is seen at $11,053. If these levels are taken out, the focus would shift to the 200-day SMA at $100,484.</p><p>A convincing move above the 50-day SMA at $116,033 would negate the bearish outlook.</p><ul><li><strong>Resistance: </strong>$116,033, $120,000, $122,056.</li><li><strong>Support: </strong>$111,982, $110,053, $100,484.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/20/markets-today-bitcoin-ether-recover-from-lows-before-fomc-minutes\">Markets Today: Bitcoin, Ether Recover From Lows Before FOMC Minutes</a></em></strong></p>",
