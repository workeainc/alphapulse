# How to Migrate Your Data from Docker to PostgreSQL on Windows

## Current Situation Assessment

Based on our troubleshooting:
- Docker Desktop never fully started
- WSL distributions (`docker-desktop`, `docker-desktop-data`) were never created
- This means **Docker volumes were never populated**

## Did You Actually Have Data in Docker?

**Key Question:** Did Docker ever work properly on this computer where you ran AlphaPulse and accumulated 1 year of data?

### Scenario A: Docker Worked Before (Data Exists)

If you previously had Docker working and AlphaPulse running with data:

**The data is in:** Docker volumes stored in `.vhdx` virtual hard disk files

**Location to check:**
- `C:\Users\EA Soft Lab\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\disk\`
- Look for files like `ext4.vhdx` (usually 1-20+ GB if it has data)

### Scenario B: Docker Never Worked (No Data)

If Docker never successfully ran AlphaPulse on this computer:
- **There is no data to migrate**
- You mentioned "1 year of data" - where is this data currently?
  - Different computer?
  - Previous backup?
  - Different database?

## Migration Methods (If Data Exists)

### Method 1: Export While Docker is Running (Easiest)

If we can get Docker running for just 5 minutes:

```powershell
# 1. Start Docker containers
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 2. Export database
docker exec alphapulse_postgres pg_dump -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse > alphapulse_backup.sql

# 3. Stop Docker
docker-compose down
```

Then restore to Windows PostgreSQL:
```powershell
psql -U postgres -d alphapulse < alphapulse_backup.sql
```

---

### Method 2: Extract from Docker Volume (Advanced)

If Docker volumes exist but Docker won't start:

#### Step 1: Find the Volume VHDX File
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\EA Soft Lab\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl" -Recurse -Filter "*.vhdx"
```

#### Step 2: Mount the VHDX (needs WSL working)
```bash
# In WSL (Ubuntu)
sudo mkdir /mnt/docker-volume
sudo mount -t drvfs 'C:\path\to\ext4.vhdx' /mnt/docker-volume
```

#### Step 3: Find PostgreSQL Data Directory
```bash
# Usually in: /var/lib/docker/volumes/postgres_data/_data
sudo find /mnt/docker-volume -name "postgres_data"
```

#### Step 4: Copy PostgreSQL Data Files
```bash
# Copy to a location accessible from Windows
sudo cp -r /mnt/docker-volume/path/to/postgres_data /mnt/c/backup/
```

#### Step 5: Import to Windows PostgreSQL

This is complex and requires:
1. Stop Windows PostgreSQL service
2. Replace data directory
3. Fix permissions
4. Start service

**Not recommended unless absolutely necessary!**

### Method 3: Access VHDX Directly (Most Technical)

1. **Download and Install 7-Zip or similar tool** that can read ext4 filesystems

2. **Mount VHDX in Windows:**
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell (Admin)
   $vhdxPath = "C:\Users\EA Soft Lab\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\disk\ext4.vhdx"
   Mount-VHD -Path $vhdxPath -ReadOnly
   ```

3. **Access mounted disk** - it will appear as a new drive letter

4. **Navigate to:** `/var/lib/docker/volumes/postgres_data/_data`

5. **Copy PostgreSQL data files** to Windows

6. **Dismount:**
   ```powershell
   Dismount-VHD -Path $vhdxPath
   ```

---

## Practical Decision Tree

### Question 1: Is there a `.vhdx` file over 1GB?

**Check:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\EA Soft Lab\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl" -Recurse -Filter "*.vhdx" | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 1GB}
```

**If YES:** You likely have data
**If NO:** Probably no significant data

### Question 2: Can we get Docker running even temporarily?

**Try:**
```powershell
# After restart with WSL/Ubuntu installed
wsl --list --verbose
# Should show: docker-desktop, docker-desktop-data

docker-compose up -d
# Then immediately export before it crashes
```

**If YES:** Use Method 1 (easiest!)
**If NO:** Use Method 2 or 3 (harder)

### Question 3: Is the data worth the effort?

**Consider:**
- How much time to extract data: 2-4 hours of technical work
- vs.
- How much time to regenerate data: Depends on your use case

**If data is CRITICAL:** Worth the effort
**If data can be recreated:** Start fresh!

---

## Recommended Approach

### Option A: Try Docker One More Time (After Restart)

After restarting with Ubuntu WSL installed:

1. Check if Docker creates distributions:
   ```powershell
   wsl --list --verbose
   ```

2. If yes, try to start containers quickly:
   ```powershell
   docker-compose up -d
   docker exec alphapulse_postgres pg_dump -U alpha_emon alphapulse > backup.sql
   ```

3. Even if Docker crashes after, you have the export!

### Option B: Start Fresh with PostgreSQL on Windows

**Advantages:**
- Clean start
- No migration headaches
- Working system in 10 minutes
- Better performance
- More stable

**Disadvantages:**
- Lose historical data (if it exists)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

1. Install PostgreSQL on Windows NOW
2. Start fresh and get working
3. Meanwhile, try to recover old data in background
4. Import old data later if you get it

---

## The Reality Check

From our troubleshooting session, here's what we know:

❌ Docker Desktop never fully started
❌ WSL distributions were never created
❌ No containers ever ran successfully
❌ Database containers never started

**This suggests:** There likely is NO data in Docker volumes to migrate!

**The "1 year of data" you mentioned:**
- Is it on a different computer?
- Is it from a previous working setup?
- Do you have SQL backup files somewhere?

---

## What To Do Right Now

### Step 1: Verify If Data Exists

Run this script to check:

```powershell
# Check for Docker volume files
$vhdxFiles = Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\EA Soft Lab\AppData\Local\Docker" -Recurse -Filter "*.vhdx" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

if ($vhdxFiles) {
    Write-Host "Found Docker volume files:"
    $vhdxFiles | ForEach-Object {
        $sizeGB = [math]::Round($_.Length / 1GB, 2)
        Write-Host "$($_.Name) - $sizeGB GB"
        
        if ($sizeGB -gt 1) {
            Write-Host "  ^ This file is large enough to contain data!"
        } else {
            Write-Host "  ^ This file is too small, probably empty"
        }
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "No Docker volume files found - NO DATA TO MIGRATE"
}
```

### Step 2: Based on Results

**If large .vhdx files exist (>1GB):**
- We can try to extract data
- Worth the effort if data is valuable

**If no large files exist:**
- **No data to migrate!**
- Install PostgreSQL on Windows and start fresh
- Much simpler!

## Quick Answer to Your Question

**"What about our old data?"**

**Most likely answer:** There is no old data in Docker because Docker never successfully ran.

**To confirm:** Run the verification script above.

**If data exists:** We can extract it (2-4 hours of work)

**If no data exists:** Install PostgreSQL on Windows and start collecting data fresh!

---

## My Recommendation

1. **First:** Run verification to confirm if data exists
2. **If NO data:** Install PostgreSQL on Windows (10 minutes) ✅
3. **If YES data:** Decide if worth 2-4 hours to extract

**Most likely scenario:** No data exists, so PostgreSQL on Windows is your best path forward!
