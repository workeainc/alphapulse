## 🔍 Monitor System Progress

### Check if System is Running

```powershell
Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 0}
```

### View Live Logs (if log file exists)

```powershell
Get-Content logs/alphapulse.log -Tail 50 -Wait
```

### Check Signal Count (After 10-15 minutes)

```powershell
docker exec -i alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_signals_mtf;"
```

### View Recent Signals

```powershell
docker exec -i alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -c "SELECT symbol, direction, entry_strategy, entry_price, TO_CHAR(timestamp, 'HH24:MI:SS') as time FROM ai_signals_mtf ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

### Check Entry Strategy Distribution

```powershell
docker exec -i alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -c "SELECT entry_strategy, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(risk_reward_ratio)::numeric(5,2) as avg_rr FROM ai_signals_mtf GROUP BY entry_strategy ORDER BY count DESC;"
```

---

## 📈 Expected Results Timeline

### After 5 Minutes:
- System fully initialized
- WebSocket connections established
- First analysis cycle completed
- Initial signals may be generated (if consensus achieved)

### After 15 Minutes:
- 5-15 signals generated (depending on market conditions)
- Multiple entry strategies visible
- Storage working correctly
- Cache populated

### After 1 Hour:
- 20-50 signals generated
- Entry strategy distribution visible
- Deduplication working
- System health: STABLE

### After 24 Hours:
- 200-800 signals generated
- Comprehensive performance data
- All entry strategies represented
- Refinement success rate established

## 🎯 Key Metrics to Watch

### Signal Generation

Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_signals,
    COUNT(DISTINCT symbol) as unique_symbols,
    AVG(signal_confidence)::numeric(4,2) as avg_confidence,
    AVG(risk_reward_ratio)::numeric(5,2) as avg_rr
FROM ai_signals_mtf
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### Entry Strategy Effectiveness

Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    entry_strategy,
    COUNT(*) as signals,
    AVG(entry_confidence)::numeric(4,2) as avg_entry_conf,
    AVG(risk_reward_ratio)::numeric(5,2) as avg_rr,
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () as percentage
FROM ai_signals_mtf
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY entry_strategy
ORDER BY signals DESC;
```

### System Performance

Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
    COUNT(*) as signals_per_hour,
    AVG(signal_confidence)::numeric(4,2) as avg_confidence
FROM ai_signals_mtf
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No Signals After 15 Minutes

**Cause:** No consensus from AI model heads (market conditions)  
**Solution:** This is normal - wait for favorable conditions

**Check:**
```powershell
# Check if analysis is happening
docker exec -i alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ohlcv_data WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';"
```

### Issue: All Entries are MARKET_ENTRY

**Cause:** Insufficient data for entry refinement (< 200 candles)  
**Solution:** Wait for more data collection (normal for first run)

**Check fallback rate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    entry_strategy,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM ai_signals_mtf
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY entry_strategy;
```

### Issue: System Stopped Unexpectedly

**Check Python process:**
```powershell
Get-Process python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**If not running, check error logs and restart:**
```powershell
cd "d:\Emon Work\AlphaPuls\apps\backend"
.\start.ps1
```

---

## 🛑 Stop the System

### Graceful Stop

1. Find the Python process:
```powershell
Get-Process python | Select-Object Id, ProcessName, StartTime
```

2. Stop it gracefully (replace PID with actual process ID):
```powershell
Stop-Process -Id <PID>
```

### Force Stop (if needed)

```powershell
Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force
```

## 📊 Quick Status Check

Run this command to get a quick overview:

```powershell
Write-Host "`n=== ALPHAPULSE MTF SYSTEM STATUS ===`n" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Check process
$process = Get-Process python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 0}
if ($process) {
    Write-Host "[OK] System is RUNNING (PID: $($process.Id))" -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host "    CPU: $($process.CPU) | Memory: $([math]::Round($process.WorkingSet64/1MB, 2)) MB" -ForegroundColor Gray
} else {
    Write-Host "[ERROR] System is NOT running" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Check signals
$signalCount = docker exec -i alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ai_signals_mtf;" 2>$null
if ($signalCount) {
    Write-Host "[OK] Signals stored: $($signalCount.Trim())" -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "[INFO] No signals yet (system starting)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}

Write-Host "`n=================================`n" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```
