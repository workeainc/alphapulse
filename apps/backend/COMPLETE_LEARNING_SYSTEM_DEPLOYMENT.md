## 🧪 Testing the Learning System

### Test 1: Check System Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/learning/stats
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "coordinator": {
    "outcomes_processed": 0,
    "head_weight_updates": 0,
    "current_head_weights": {
      "HEAD_A": 0.111,
      "HEAD_B": 0.111,
      ...
    }
  },
  "monitor": {
    "is_running": true,
    "checks_performed": 0,
    "signals_monitored": 0
  }
}
```

**Key indicator:** `"is_running": true` ✅

---

### Test 2: Check Scheduler

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/learning/scheduler
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "scheduler": {
    "scheduler_running": true,
    "total_jobs": 2,
    "jobs": [
      {
        "id": "daily_learning",
        "name": "Daily Learning Job",
        "next_run_time": "2025-10-30T00:00:00+00:00"
      },
      {
        "id": "weekly_retraining",
        "name": "Weekly Retraining Job",
        "next_run_time": "2025-11-03T02:00:00+00:00"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key indicators:**
- `"scheduler_running": true` ✅
- `"total_jobs": 2` ✅
- `next_run_time` shows future dates ✅

---

### Test 3: Manual Job Trigger (Optional)

Test the daily learning job manually:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/learning/trigger-daily
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "message": "Daily learning job triggered manually"
}
```

Check your logs - you should see:
```
🌙 DAILY LEARNING JOB STARTED
...
✅ DAILY LEARNING JOB COMPLETED
```

---

### Test 4: Wait for Real Signal Outcome

The ultimate test - wait for a signal to hit TP or SL:

**Monitor logs:**
```powershell
# Watch for outcome detection
python -c "import requests, time; [print(requests.get('http://localhost:8000/api/learning/stats').json()) or time.sleep(60) for _ in range(100)]"
```

**When outcome detected, you'll see:**
```
✅ TP HIT detected: INTEL_ABC123 (BTCUSDT long)
✅ TP HIT processed: INTEL_ABC123, P/L: 2.35%
🔄 Processing outcome for INTEL_ABC123: TP_HIT
✅ Head weights updated: Max change=0.0234
   HEAD_A: 0.1110 → 0.1234 (+0.0124)
✅ Learning completed for INTEL_ABC123: Win=True, P/L=2.35%
```

**This means learning is working!** 🎊

## 🎓 How It All Works Together

### Real-Time Learning (Immediate):

```
1. Signal Generated with 9-head consensus
   ↓
2. Signal hits TP or SL
   ↓
3. Outcome Monitor detects hit (checks every 60s)
   ↓
4. Database updated: live_signals → signal_history
   ↓
5. Learning Coordinator triggered
   ↓
6. Analyzes which heads were correct/incorrect
   ↓
7. Updates head weights (EMA with 5% learning rate)
   ↓
8. Stores new weights in database (versioned)
   ↓
9. Next signal uses improved weights ✨
```

### Scheduled Learning (Batch):

**Daily Job (00:00 UTC):**
```
1. Get last 24 hours of outcomes
2. Calculate daily win rate and metrics
3. Update head weights incrementally (3% rate)
4. Store daily performance report
5. Log learning event
```

**Weekly Job (Sunday 02:00 UTC):**
```
1. Get last 7 days of outcomes (minimum 50 required)
2. Calculate optimal head weights statistically
3. Backtest new vs old weights
4. Deploy if improvement > 3%
5. Generate weekly performance report
```

## 🧠 Learning Algorithm Details

### Head Weight Update Formula:

```python
For each signal outcome:
  For each of 9 heads:
    if head_agreed and signal_won:
        adjustment = +learning_rate * head_confidence
    elif head_agreed and signal_lost:
        adjustment = -learning_rate * head_confidence
    elif head_disagreed and signal_won:
        adjustment = -learning_rate * 0.5  # Missed opportunity
    elif head_disagreed and signal_lost:
        adjustment = +learning_rate * 0.5  # Good rejection
    
    new_weight = old_weight + adjustment
    
    # Apply bounds
    new_weight = max(0.05, min(0.30, new_weight))

# Normalize all weights to sum to 1.0
for head in all_heads:
    normalized_weight = head_weight / sum(all_weights)
```

### Parameters:
- **Learning Rate (Real-time)**: 5% per outcome
- **Learning Rate (Daily)**: 3% per batch
- **EMA Alpha**: 0.05 (smooth transitions)
- **Min Weight**: 0.05 (5% - no head disabled)
- **Max Weight**: 0.30 (30% - no head dominates)

---

## 📱 Monitoring & Alerts

### Watch Learning in Real-Time:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Watch for learning events
while ($true) {
    $stats = Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/api/learning/stats
    Clear-Host
    $stats | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 10
}
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Watch logs for learning events
tail -f logs/alphapulse.log | grep -E "TP HIT|SL HIT|weights updated|Learning completed"
```

### Database Monitoring:

```sql
-- See recent learning activity
SELECT 
    event_type, 
    signal_id, 
    triggered_by,
    event_timestamp
FROM learning_events
ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Check weight evolution
SELECT 
    version,
    state_data->>'HEAD_A' as head_a_weight,
    state_data->>'HEAD_B' as head_b_weight,
    created_at
FROM learning_state
WHERE state_type = 'head_weights'
ORDER BY version DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Performance trend
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', signal_timestamp) as day,
    COUNT(*) as signals,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN outcome = 'win' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END), 4) as win_rate
FROM signal_history
WHERE signal_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND source = 'live'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', signal_timestamp)
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Safeguards in Place:

1. **Minimum Data Requirements:**
   - Daily job: Requires 10+ outcomes
   - Weekly job: Requires 50+ outcomes
   - Prevents premature optimization

2. **Bounded Updates:**
   - Max 20% weight change per update
   - Prevents wild swings from outliers

3. **Weight Limits:**
   - Minimum 5% (no head disabled completely)
   - Maximum 30% (no single head dominates)

4. **Validation:**
   - Weekly job only deploys if >3% improvement
   - Automatic rollback capability via versioning

5. **Error Handling:**
   - All jobs fail gracefully
   - System continues even if jobs fail
   - Extensive logging for debugging

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Docker Not Running

**Error:** "Docker Desktop is unable to start"

**Solution:**
1. Start Docker Desktop manually
2. Wait for it to fully start (30-60 seconds)
3. Run: `docker ps` to verify
4. Then apply migration

---

### Migration Already Applied

**Error:** "relation already exists"

**Solution:** This is fine! Migration is idempotent. The tables already exist.

**Verify:**
```powershell
docker exec -it alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -c "\dt learning*"
```

---

### Learning System Not Initializing

**Error:** "Learning system not initialized"

**Check:**
1. Was migration applied? Check tables exist
2. Are there any startup errors in logs?
3. Is database connection working?

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check migration
docker exec -it alphapulse_postgres psql -U alpha_emon -d alphapulse -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM active_learning_state;"

# Should return: 3 rows (head_weights, confidence_threshold, learning_config)
```

---

### No Outcomes Detected

**After 24 hours, no outcomes:**

**Check:**
1. Are signals being generated? `SELECT * FROM live_signals;`
2. Are prices being checked? Check monitor logs
3. Are TP/SL levels realistic?

**Debug:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/signals/active
# Check if there are active signals to monitor
```
