# Historical Data Download Status

## Current Status: **NOT COMPLETE**

### Issue Identified

The download script downloaded ~519,000 candles but **stored 0 candles** in the database.

**Root Cause:**
- Script was interrupted (Ctrl+C) before storage completed
- Batch storage code was added but script may have been running old version
- No storage messages in log = storage never executed

### Data Downloaded (Lost)
- BTCUSDT 1m: ~519,000 candles downloaded but not stored
- All other symbols/timeframes: Not started

### Fix Applied

1. ✅ Added batch storage every 50,000 candles (prevents memory issues)
2. ✅ Improved error handling with detailed logging
3. ✅ Storage happens during download, not just at end
4. ✅ Better error messages if storage fails

### Next Steps

**Run the fixed script:**
```powershell
cd "D:\Emon Work\AlphaPuls\apps\backend"
python scripts/download_1year_historical_direct.py
```

**What to expect:**
- Progress messages every 20,000 candles
- **Storage messages every 50,000 candles** (NEW - will show "BATCH STORAGE TRIGGERED")
- Data will be saved incrementally
- If interrupted, already-stored data will be preserved

**Estimated time:** ~25 minutes for full download

**Monitor progress:**
```powershell
# Watch log in real-time
Get-Content historical_download.log -Tail 20 -Wait

# Check stored data
python scripts/check_download_status.py
```

### Verification

After download completes, verify:
```powershell
python scripts/check_download_status.py
```

Expected results:
- BTCUSDT 1m: ~525,600 candles
- BTCUSDT 5m: ~105,120 candles
- BTCUSDT 15m: ~35,040 candles
- BTCUSDT 1h: ~8,760 candles
- (Repeat for all 5 symbols)

### Troubleshooting

If storage still doesn't work:
1. Check database connection: `python scripts/verify_database_schema.py`
2. Check unique constraint: `python scripts/fix_unique_constraint.py`
3. Check log for specific errors: `Get-Content historical_download.log | Select-String "ERROR"`
