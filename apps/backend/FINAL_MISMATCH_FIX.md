# ✅ FINAL MISMATCH FIX - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Technical Analysis summary shows different % than Final Score  
**Status:** 🟢 RESOLVED

---

## 🔴 **THE MISMATCH (From Your Screenshot)**

```
Technical Analysis Summary: SHORT 61.4%  ← This value
Final Score (breakdown):    72%           ← Doesn't match this!
```

**User:** "That shouldn't happen!"

---

## ✅ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

The technical head's `confidence` field was being set to `result.confidence` (which is calculated from category agreement), but the `Final_Score` in breakdown was set to `result.technical_score` (the actual weighted score).

**These are DIFFERENT values:**
- `result.confidence` = Based on how well categories agree (can be 61%)
- `result.technical_score` = Actual weighted score from indicators (can be 72%)

**Fix:** Use `technical_score` for BOTH!

## 🛠️ **FIX APPLIED**

### **File:** `apps/backend/scripts/generate_full_indicator_signals.py`

**Changed:**
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
'confidence': result.confidence,  # Category agreement (61%)

# AFTER (Correct):
'confidence': result.technical_score,  # Actual score (72%)
```

**Result:**
- Summary now shows: 72%
- Final Score shows: 72%
- **PERFECT MATCH!** ✅
