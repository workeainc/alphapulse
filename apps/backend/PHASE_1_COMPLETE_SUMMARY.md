## 🎓 Learning Algorithm Details

### Weight Update Formula:

```python
# For each head after signal outcome:
if head_agreed and signal_won:
    adjustment = +learning_rate * head_confidence
elif head_agreed and signal_lost:
    adjustment = -learning_rate * head_confidence
elif head_disagreed and signal_won:
    adjustment = -learning_rate * 0.5  # Missed opportunity
elif head_disagreed and signal_lost:
    adjustment = +learning_rate * 0.5  # Good rejection

new_weight = old_weight + adjustment

# Apply bounds
new_weight = max(0.05, min(0.30, new_weight))

# Normalize all weights to sum to 1.0
normalized_weights = {head: weight / sum(all_weights) for head, weight in weights.items()}
```

### Parameters:
- **Learning Rate**: 0.05 (5% adjustment per outcome)
- **EMA Alpha**: 0.05 (smooth transitions)
- **Min Weight**: 0.05 (5% - no head completely disabled)
- **Max Weight**: 0.30 (30% - no head dominates)
- **Update Threshold**: 0.01 (1% - only significant changes applied)

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Safeguards Implemented:

1. **Bounded Updates**
   - Maximum 20% weight change per update
   - Prevents wild swings from single outcomes

2. **Weight Limits**
   - Minimum 5% (prevents complete disabling)
   - Maximum 30% (prevents single head dominance)

3. **Normalization**
   - All weights always sum to 1.0
   - Maintains valid probability distribution

4. **Version Control**
   - Every weight change saved with version number
   - Easy rollback if needed

5. **Audit Trail**
   - All learning events logged
   - Full traceability of decisions

6. **Minimum Data Requirement**
   - Requires sufficient outcomes before major changes
   - Prevents premature optimization

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Scope:

**What IS Implemented (Phase 1 + 3):**
- ✅ Real-time outcome monitoring
- ✅ 9-head weight optimization
- ✅ Performance analytics
- ✅ Dashboard APIs
- ✅ Version control

**What is NOT Yet Implemented (Phase 2):**
- ❌ Daily learning job (scheduled updates)
- ❌ Weekly retraining job (full model optimization)
- ❌ Indicator weight optimization
- ❌ Adaptive threshold adjustment
- ❌ Automated scheduling

**Impact:** 
- Phase 1 provides **real-time learning** after each outcome
- Phase 2 would add **batch optimization** for accumulated data
- Current implementation is sufficient for continuous improvement
- Phase 2 is optional enhancement for future

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track:

**1. System Health:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/learning/stats
```
- `is_running: true` → Monitor active
- `outcomes_processed` → Should increase
- `head_weight_updates` → Should increase over time

**2. Performance:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/learning/performance
```
- `win_rate` → Target: 70%+ (currently ~62% baseline)
- `profit_factor` → Target: 2.0+ (wins 2x larger than losses)
- `sharpe_ratio` → Target: 1.5+ (good risk-adjusted returns)

**3. Learning Progress:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/learning/improvements
```
- `weekly_trends` → Should show improvement
- `best_performing_heads` → Identifies strongest heads
- `worst_performing_heads` → Identifies weak heads

**4. Database:**
```sql
-- Check learning events (should grow over time)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM learning_events;

-- Check weight versions (should increment)
SELECT MAX(version) FROM learning_state WHERE state_type = 'head_weights';

-- Check recent outcomes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM signal_history WHERE completed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```
