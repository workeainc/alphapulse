- **Prevents regime-inappropriate signals**

#### **6. Signal Aggregation Window**
`apps/backend/src/core/signal_aggregation_window.py`
- Cooldown management
- Same symbol: 60 min, Same direction: 30 min, Any: 15 min

- Aggregates to 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d automatically
- Efficient buffering
- **Enables frequent scanning without overhead**

#### **8. Intelligent Production Backend**
`apps/backend/intelligent_production_main.py`
- Integrates ALL components
- Connects to Binance WebSocket (1m candles)
- Runs complete quality pipeline
- **Production-ready API**

## 📊 **QUALITY CONTROL PIPELINE**

### **7-Stage Filter (98-99% Rejection):**

```
100 Candle Scans (every 15 min)
    ↓
GATE 1: SDE Bias Strength (5+/9 heads, 80%+ conf)
    ↓ 60 rejected
    ↓ 40 pass
    ↓
GATE 2: Confluence Score (70%+ required)
    ↓ 36 rejected
    ↓ 4 pass
    ↓
GATE 3: Risk/Reward (2.5:1+ required)
    ↓ 2 rejected
    ↓ 2 pass
    ↓
GATE 4: Historical Performance (60%+ win rate)
    ↓ 1 rejected
    ↓ 1 pass
    ↓
GATE 5: Regime Limits (max 1-3 per regime)
    ↓ 0 rejected (under limit)
    ↓ 1 pass
    ↓
GATE 6: Cooldown Windows (15-60 min)
    ↓ 0 rejected (cooldown satisfied)
    ↓ 1 pass
    ↓
GATE 7: Deduplication (one per symbol)
    ↓ 0 rejected (no existing signal)
    ↓ 1 FINAL SIGNAL
    ↓
RESULT: 1 signal from 100 scans = 1% pass rate
```

## ⚡ **HOW IT ANSWERS YOUR CONCERNS**

### **Concern: "Every 15 min = noise"**

**Answer:**
✅ Checks every 1-60 min (adaptive to regime)  
✅ But generates only when ALL 7 gates pass  
✅ Result: 1-3 signals per DAY (not per hour)  
✅ 98-99% rejection rate ensures quality  

**Example:**
- System checks BTCUSDT every 15 min (96 times/day)
- 95 scans → No entry confluence → Rejected
- 1 scan → Perfect confluence → Signal generated
- **Pass rate: 1%**

### **Concern: "Want adaptive like human brain"**

**Answer:**
✅ Regime detector adapts timeframes  
✅ Confluence finder uses multiple factors  
✅ Historical validator learns from outcomes  
✅ NOT hardcoded rules - dynamic adaptation  

**Example:**
- TRENDING market → System uses 4h/1h (rides trend)
- Market changes to RANGING → System switches to 1h/15m (scalps edges)
- **Adapts automatically!**

### **Concern: "Want quality, not quantity"**

**Answer:**
✅ Multi-stage quality filtering  
✅ Historical performance validation  
✅ Strict thresholds (70%+ confluence, 60%+ historical)  
✅ Cooldown periods prevent spam  
✅ Target: 1-3 signals/day per symbol

## 📈 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Typical Day:**

```
00:00 - System starts monitoring
01:30 - BTCUSDT scan → Low confluence → Rejected
03:00 - ETHUSDT scan → Weak SDE bias → Rejected
05:45 - BTCUSDT scan → High confluence + Strong bias → SIGNAL! ✅
07:15 - SOLUSDT scan → Good setup but symbol cooldown → Rejected
09:30 - BNBUSDT scan → Poor historical win rate → Rejected
12:00 - ETHUSDT scan → All gates pass → SIGNAL! ✅
15:20 - ADAUSDT scan → Regime limit reached → Rejected
18:45 - LINKUSDT scan → Perfect setup → SIGNAL! ✅
21:00 - Multiple scans → System cooldown → Rejected

Total: 3 signals from ~100+ scans = 3% pass rate
```
