- Volume is absolutely critical for phase validation
- Cause-effect measurement helps with realistic targets

### Harmonic Patterns:
- Ratio precision directly correlates with pattern quality

## üí° Usage Example

```python
# Initialize all heads
from apps.backend.src.ai.model_heads import ModelHeadsManager
from apps.backend.src.ai.consensus_manager import ConsensusManager

manager = ModelHeadsManager()
consensus = ConsensusManager()

# Prepare market data
market_data = {
    'symbol': 'BTCUSDT',
    'timeframe': '1h',
    'current_price': 43250.00
}

analysis_results = {
    'dataframe': df,  # OHLCV DataFrame
    'multi_timeframe_data': {...}  # Optional
}

# Run all 8 heads in parallel
head_results = await manager.analyze_all_heads(market_data, analysis_results)

# Check consensus (need 4 out of 8 agreeing)
consensus_result = await consensus.check_consensus(head_results)

if consensus_result.consensus_achieved:
    print(f"Signal: {consensus_result.consensus_direction}")
    print(f"Confidence: {consensus_result.consensus_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Agreeing heads: {len(consensus_result.agreeing_heads)}/8")
    
    # Access individual head reasoning
    for result in head_results:
        if result.head_type in consensus_result.agreeing_heads:
            print(f"{result.head_type.value}: {result.reasoning}")
