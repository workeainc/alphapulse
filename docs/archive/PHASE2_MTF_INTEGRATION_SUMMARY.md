## 🎯 Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Factor Confidence Formula

The system implements a sophisticated confidence scoring formula:

```python
final_confidence = (
    base_confidence * 
    (1 + mtf_boost) * 
    alignment_factor * 
    volume_factor
)
```

Where:
- **base_confidence**: Raw pattern detection confidence (0-1)
- **mtf_boost**: Higher timeframe alignment bonus (0-1)
- **alignment_factor**: Trend alignment multiplier (0.8-1.25)
- **volume_factor**: Volume confirmation multiplier (0.8-1.20)

### 2. Priority-Based Signal Filtering

Signals are automatically filtered and prioritized:

- **High Priority**: Confidence ≥ 0.8, strong MTF alignment
- **Medium Priority**: Confidence ≥ 0.7, moderate MTF alignment  
- **Low Priority**: Confidence ≥ 0.6, weak MTF alignment

### 3. Dynamic Symbol Management

The system supports dynamic addition and removal of symbols:

```python
# Add new symbol
await integration.add_symbol("DOTUSDT")

# Remove symbol
await integration.remove_symbol("ADAUSDT")

# Get current status
status = await integration.get_integration_status()
```

### 4. Comprehensive Performance Monitoring

Real-time performance tracking includes:

- **Processing Times**: Average, min, max processing times
- **Success Rates**: Percentage of successful operations
- **Cache Statistics**: Hit rates and efficiency metrics
