## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Position Sizing Methods

#### Kelly Criterion
```python
Kelly % = (bp - q) / b
where:
b = odds received on the bet (avg_win / avg_loss)
p = probability of winning (win_rate)
q = probability of losing (1 - win_rate)
```

#### Volatility Adjusted Sizing
- Adjusts position size based on current market volatility
- Higher volatility = smaller positions
- Market condition multipliers for different regimes

#### Risk-Adjusted Sizing
- Confidence score adjustment (0.5 to 1.0 multiplier)
- Correlation-based position reduction
- Drawdown-based defensive sizing

### Risk Metrics Calculation

#### Value at Risk (VaR)
- Historical simulation method
- 95% confidence level
- Position-specific and portfolio-level VaR

#### Portfolio Volatility
- Weighted average of individual position volatilities
- Rolling volatility calculation with configurable lookback

#### Sharpe Ratio
- Risk-adjusted return calculation
- Annualized using 252 trading days
- Portfolio-level performance metric

### Market Condition Detection

#### Trend Detection
- Linear regression slope analysis
- Normalized slope thresholds
- 20-period lookback window

#### Volatility Classification
- Low volatility: < 15%
- Moderate volatility: 15% - 40%
- High volatility: > 40%

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Position Sizing
```python
from ai.position_sizing import position_sizing_optimizer, SizingParameters, MarketCondition

# Create sizing parameters
params = SizingParameters(
    symbol="BTCUSDT",
    entry_price=50000,
    stop_loss=48000,
    take_profit=52000,
    confidence_score=0.8,
    win_rate=0.6,
    avg_win=2000,
    avg_loss=1000,
    volatility=0.25,
    market_condition=MarketCondition.TRENDING_UP,
    current_drawdown=0.05,
    portfolio_correlation=0.3,
    available_capital=100000
)

# Get optimal position size
method, result = position_sizing_optimizer.get_optimal_method(params, "balanced")
print(f"Position size: {result.position_size:.2f} shares")
print(f"Risk percentage: {result.risk_percentage:.2%}")
```

### Risk Monitoring
```python
from ai.risk_management import risk_manager

# Update position
risk_manager.update_position("BTCUSDT", PositionType.LONG, 1.0, 50000, 51000)

# Get risk summary
risk_summary = risk_manager.get_risk_summary()
print(f"Portfolio PnL: ${risk_summary['portfolio_metrics']['total_pnl']:,.2f}")
print(f"Portfolio VaR: ${risk_summary['portfolio_metrics']['portfolio_var_95']:,.2f}")

# Check for alerts
alerts = risk_manager.check_risk_limits()
for alert in alerts:
    print(f"Alert: {alert['message']}")
```

### Async Risk Monitoring
```python
import asyncio

# Start continuous monitoring
await risk_manager.start_monitoring()

# Stop monitoring
await risk_manager.stop_monitoring()
```
