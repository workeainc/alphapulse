### Short-term (Medium Priority)
5. Update API documentation
6. Create user guide for signal recommendations
7. Set up alerts/notifications for high-confidence signals
8. Test backward compatibility

### Long-term (Low Priority)
9. Remove backward compatibility aliases (v3.0.0)
10. Archive old execution tests
11. Create video tutorial for using recommendations
12. Performance optimization on signal generation

---

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:

```bash
# 1. Rollback database
cd backend/database/migrations
python rename_trades_to_recommendations.py down

# 2. Restore archived files (manual)
# Copy files from backend/archived/ back to original locations

# 3. Revert git commits
git revert HEAD~N  # where N is number of commits to revert
```

---

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully transformed AlphaPulse from a trading execution platform to a pure signal analysis and recommendation engine. This aligns the codebase with the clarified core concept and removes unnecessary complexity.

**Key Achievement:** 4,000 lines of execution code archived, architecture simplified, and purpose clarified.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND READY FOR TESTING
