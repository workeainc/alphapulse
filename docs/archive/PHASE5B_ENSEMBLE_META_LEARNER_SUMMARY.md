    def detect_regime(self, features: pd.DataFrame) -> Tuple[MarketRegime, float]:
        # Detect current market regime with confidence
        
    def select_best_models(self, regime: MarketRegime, top_k: int = 3):
        # Select best performing models for current regime

        # Get model weights for specific regime
```
