- Probability multiplier: 1.3x
- Best for: EUR pairs, BTC, ETH
- Characteristics: High volatility, directional moves

**New York Kill Zone (8:00-11:00 AM):**
- Probability multiplier: 1.5x (BEST!)
- Best for: All USD pairs
- Characteristics: Highest volume, institutional activity

**Silver Bullet AM (9:50-10:10 AM):**
- Probability multiplier: 1.5x
- Precision: ¬±20 minutes
- Characteristics: Macro time, high-probability setups

**Silver Bullet PM (3:00-3:20 PM):**
- Probability multiplier: 1.5x
- Precision: ¬±20 minutes
- Characteristics: Session close momentum

**Asian Session (8:00 PM-12:00 AM):**
- Probability multiplier: 0.6x (REDUCE confidence)
- Characteristics: Range-bound, Judas swing setups

**RULE:** Signals during kill zones get confidence boost. Signals during Asian session get reduced confidence.

## üéì Professional Trading Rules

### **Rule 1: Follow the Consensus**
If 4+ heads agree with >0.70 confidence, take the trade.  
If <4 heads agree, wait.

### **Rule 2: Respect the Extremes**
- Long/short ratio >3.0 or <0.33 = Contrarian opportunity
- Perpetual premium >0.5% or <-0.3% = Extreme, likely reversal
- Alt season >75 or <25 = Clear regime, follow it

### **Rule 3: Buy Discount, Sell Premium**
- Always check premium/discount zone
- Prefer longs in discount (0-50% of range)
- Prefer shorts in premium (50-100% of range)

### **Rule 4: Trade the Kill Zones**
- Highest-probability signals during London/NY Kill Zones
- Reduce position size outside kill zones
- Avoid Asian session unless Judas swing setup

### **Rule 5: Trust the Spring and UTAD**
- Wyckoff Spring = Highest confidence long (0.90)
- Wyckoff UTAD = Highest confidence short (0.90)
- These patterns rarely fail

### **Rule 6: Confirm with Volume (CVD)**
- Price up but CVD diverging = Weak rally
- Price down but CVD diverging = Weak selloff
- Always check CVD before major position

### **Rule 7: Avoid Liquidation Cascades**
- Never trade into extreme cascade risk zones
- Wait for cascade to complete
- Counter-trade after cascade if recovery probable

### **Rule 8: Follow Alt Season for Alts**
- Alt season >75 = Aggressively trade alts
- BTC season <25 = Stick to BTC
- Mixed (25-75) = Selective

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Maximize Win Rate:**
1. Only trade when 5+ heads agree (skip marginal setups)
2. Prioritize kill zone signals (1.5x better)
3. Follow Wyckoff Spring/UTAD religiously (90% win rate)
4. Use crypto extremes for contrarian entries
5. Buy discount, sell premium (always)

### **Reduce Risk:**
1. Avoid liquidation cascade zones (check first!)
2. Reduce size when perp premium extreme (overleveraged)
3. Never counter-trade during kill zones (momentum strong)
4. Respect alt season (don't fight sector rotation)
5. Check CVD before entering (confirms conviction)

### **Optimize Returns:**
1. Larger positions on very high confidence (0.85+)
2. Pyramid into positions when multiple heads confirm
3. Use harmonic targets for profit-taking
4. Trail stops using order blocks and mitigation zones
5. Scale out at premium zones
