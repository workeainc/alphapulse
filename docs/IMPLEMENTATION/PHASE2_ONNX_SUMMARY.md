## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Model Conversion Pipeline
```python
# Example usage
converter = ONNXConverter(onnx_dir="models/onnx")

# Convert XGBoost model
onnx_path = converter.convert_model(
    model=xgb_model,
    model_name="my_xgb_model",
    input_shape=(10,),
    model_type="xgboost"
)
```

### 2. Latency Performance Measurement
```python
# Measure performance improvement
latency_results = converter.measure_latency_improvement(
    model=model,
    onnx_path=onnx_path,
    test_data=X_test,
    n_runs=100
)

# Results include:
# - native_avg_ms: Average native inference time
# - onnx_avg_ms: Average ONNX inference time
# - improvement_pct: Percentage improvement
# - speedup_factor: Speedup multiplier
```

### 3. Fallback Mechanism
- Automatic fallback to native inference when ONNX fails
- Graceful error handling with detailed error messages
- Performance tracking even when ONNX conversion fails

### 4. Integration with Existing Infrastructure
- Compatible with `MLModelTrainer`
- Works with `ModelRegistry`
- Supports the complete retraining pipeline
- Integrates with shadow deployment system

## Performance Benefits

- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint
- **Deployment**: Cross-platform model deployment
- **Scalability**: Better support for high-throughput inference

### Fallback Strategy
- **Primary**: ONNX inference for maximum performance
- **Fallback**: Native model inference when ONNX unavailable
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking for both paths

## Integration Points

### 1. Model Training Pipeline
- ONNX conversion integrated into training workflow
- Automatic conversion after successful model training
- Performance validation before deployment

### 2. Shadow Deployment
