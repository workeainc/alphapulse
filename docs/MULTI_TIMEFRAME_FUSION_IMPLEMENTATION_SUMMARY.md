- **Volatile Markets**: -50% for short timeframes, +20% for long timeframes

### Signal Fusion Algorithm

#### Weighted Signal Calculation
```python
weighted_direction = Œ£(direction_value √ó weight)
weighted_strength = Œ£(strength_value √ó weight)
weighted_confidence = Œ£(confidence √ó weight)
```

- **Confidence**: Weighted average confidence across timeframes

#### Fusion Criteria
- Minimum confidence threshold: 0.6

- High confidence levels across timeframes
- Strong signal consistency

#### Volatile Detection
- High signal strength in short-term timeframes
- Conflicting signals across timeframes
- Low signal consistency

#### Ranging Detection
- Mixed signals across timeframes

# Generate bullish scenario
signals = signal_generator.generate_bullish_scenario("BTCUSDT", 50000.0)

# Fuse signals
fused_signal = multi_timeframe_fusion.fuse_signals("BTCUSDT", signals, 50000.0)

if fused_signal:
    print(f"Direction: {fused_signal.primary_direction.value}")
    print(f"Strength: {fused_signal.overall_strength.value}")
    print(f"Confidence: {fused_signal.confidence_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Recommendation: {fused_signal.recommended_action}")
```

### Position Sizing Integration
```python
# Get position sizing recommendation
sizing_rec = multi_timeframe_fusion.get_position_size_recommendation(
    fused_signal, available_capital=100000.0
)

print(f"Position size: {sizing_rec['position_size']:.4f} shares")
print(f"Risk percentage: {sizing_rec['risk_percentage']:.2%}")
print(f"Sizing method: {sizing_rec['sizing_method']}")
```

### Performance Tracking
```python
# Update performance metrics
multi_timeframe_fusion.update_performance_metrics("BTCUSDT", pnl=1000.0, max_drawdown=200.0)
