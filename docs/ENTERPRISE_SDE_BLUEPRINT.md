---

### **3. MODEL HEADS (Machine Learning Ensemble)**
**Purpose**: Generate probabilistic predictions from feature vectors

**Model Architecture**:
```python
# Head A: CatBoost Classifier (Primary)
- Input: Full feature vector (200+ features)
- Output: P(win_long), P(win_short), P(flat)
- Strengths: Handles missing data, categorical features
- Training: Daily retraining with 30-day lookback

# Head B: Logistic Regression (Fast Fallback)
- Input: Hand-crafted feature subset (50 features)
- Output: P(win_long), P(win_short)
- Strengths: Fast inference, interpretable
- Training: Weekly retraining

# Head C: Orderbook Tree (Specialized)
- Input: Orderbook features only (20 features)
- Output: P(win_long), P(win_short)
- Strengths: Orderbook-specific patterns
- Training: Only when orderbook data quality > 0.8

# Head D: Rule-Based Scoring (Deterministic)
- Input: Rule-based signal scores
- Output: P(win_long), P(win_short)
- Strengths: No training required, interpretable
- Training: N/A (rule-based)
```

**Consensus Logic**:
```python
# Strict Consensus Requirements
- Minimum 3/4 heads must agree
- Each agreeing head must have P >= 0.70
- All agreeing heads must output same direction
- Consensus score = weighted average of agreeing heads
```

---

### **4. STACKER (Meta-Learner & Calibration)**
**Purpose**: Combine model predictions and calibrate probabilities

**Calibration Methods**:
```python
# Isotonic Calibration

- Output: Calibrated probabilities
- Method: Parametric calibration
- Validation: Cross-validation

# Temperature Scaling
- Input: Raw model probabilities
- Output: Calibrated probabilities
- Method: Single parameter scaling
- Validation: Validation set optimization
```

**Expected Return Calculation**:
```python
# Historical Analysis
- Calculate E[R] for each setup type
- Regime-specific return expectations
- Risk-adjusted return metrics
- Maximum drawdown analysis
```

---

### **5. DECISION LOGIC (Utility Maximization)**
**Purpose**: Make final trading decisions based on expected utility

**Expected Utility Calculation**:
```python
# Utility Functions
EU_long = P_long * E[R_long] - (1 - P_long) * 1
EU_short = P_short * E[R_short] - (1 - P_short) * 1

# Where:
# P_long/P_short = calibrated probabilities
# E[R_long]/E[R_short] = expected returns from historical analysis
# 1 = assumed loss on stop (1R)
```

**Decision Gates**:
```python
# Abstain Conditions
- max(EU) < 0.15  # Minimum expected utility
- RR_est < 2.0    # Minimum risk/reward ratio
- data_health < 0.6  # Minimum data quality
- spread > 0.12 * ATR  # Maximum spread
- news_impact <= -0.6  # Negative news override

# Signal Selection
- Choose argmax(EU) → LONG/SHORT
- Score = 100 * max(EU, 0)
- Clip score to 70 if data_health < 0.8
```

---

### **6. STOPS & TARGETS (Risk Management)**
**Purpose**: Calculate precise entry, stop, and target levels

**Stop Loss Calculation**:
```python
# Stop Types
- Reversal: zone_far_edge ± 0.6×ATR
- Break-retest: retest_swing ± 0.4×ATR
- Momentum: structure_low/high ± 0.3×ATR

# Stop Validation
- Minimum stop distance: 0.5×ATR
- Maximum stop distance: 2.0×ATR
- Stop must be beyond recent swing
```

**Take Profit Structure**:
```python
# Four TP Levels
TP1: 0.5R (25% of position)
TP2: 1.0R (25% of position)
TP3: 2.0R (25% of position)
TP4: 4.0R or next HTF level (25% of position)

# Partial Exit Logic
- Automatic position size reduction
- Move stop to BE + buffer after TP2
- Trail stop after TP3 hit
```

---

### **7. DATA HEALTH MASKING (Graceful Degradation)**
**Purpose**: Handle missing or low-quality data gracefully

**Health Metrics**:
```python
# Data Quality Scores (0-1)
- price_data_health: float
- volume_data_health: float
- orderbook_data_health: float
- sentiment_data_health: float
- technical_data_health: float

# Overall Health
data_health = weighted_average(component_health_scores)
```

**Degradation Rules**:
```python
# Missing Data Handling
- Zero out missing features
- Add penalty: EU *= 0.9
- Block signals if health < 0.6

# Quality Thresholds
- Minimum health for signal: 0.9
- Graceful degradation: 0.6-0.9
- Hard block: < 0.6
```
