  - Scripts → `deployment/`

### ✅ **Cleanup Completed**
- **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate test directories
- **Cleaned Temporary Files**: Removed `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.benchmarks/`, `.coverage`
- **Organized Source Code**: Clean, logical structure for all components

## 🔧 **Phase 3: Import Path Fixing**

### ✅ **Comprehensive Import Fixes**
- **Total Files Processed**: 615
- **Files Fixed**: 291
- **Files Unchanged**: 324

### ✅ **What Was Fixed**
- **Backend**: 240/547 files fixed
