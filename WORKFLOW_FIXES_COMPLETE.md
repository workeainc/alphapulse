# ✅ Workflow Fixes & Live Monitoring - Complete

## **🔧 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Database Storage for New Candles** ✅

**Problem**: New WebSocket candles were only stored in memory, not persisted to database.

**Fix**: Added database INSERT in `on_1m_candle()` callback:
- Location: `apps/backend/main.py` lines 395-420
- Stores every new 1m candle to `ohlcv_data` table
- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicates
- Source marked as 'websocket' to distinguish from historical data

**Result**: 
- ✅ New candles are now persisted every minute
- ✅ Data survives backend restarts
- ✅ Can rebuild indicators from complete history

---

### **2. Real-Time Workflow Monitoring** ✅

**New Features**:

#### **A. Statistics Tracking**
- `candles_received`: Counter for all candles from WebSocket
- `candles_stored`: Counter for successfully stored candles
- `last_candle_time`: Timestamp of last candle per symbol
- `indicator_calculations`: Number of indicator calculations performed
- `consensus_calculations`: Number of 9-head consensus calculations
- `head_votes`: Last consensus vote breakdown per symbol/timeframe
- `workflow_steps`: Last 100 workflow events

#### **B. New API Endpoints**

**`GET /api/system/workflow`**:
Returns complete workflow status:
```json
{
  "workflow_status": {
    "data_collection": {
      "candles_received": 1250,
      "candles_stored": 1248,
      "last_candle_times": {...},
      "time_since_last_candle": {...},
      "status": "active"
    },
    "indicator_calculation": {
      "calculations_performed": 45,
      "buffer_status": {...},
      "status": "active"
    },
    "consensus_system": {
      "calculations_performed": 45,
      "last_consensus_votes": {...},
      "status": "active"
    },
    "signal_generation": {
      "scans_performed": 45,
      "signals_generated": 0,
      "rejection_rate": "100.0%",
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  "recent_workflow_steps": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T..."
}
```

**Enhanced `GET /api/system/stats`**:
Now includes workflow metrics:
- `candles_received`
- `candles_stored`
- `indicator_calculations`
- `consensus_calculations`
- `last_candle_time`

#### **C. WebSocket Workflow Updates**

**Event Types**:
1. **`workflow_status`**: Periodic status update (every 10 seconds)
2. **`workflow_update`**: Real-time event updates:
   - `candle_received`: New candle received and stored
   - `candle_complete`: Candle closed, processing started
   - `indicator_calculation`: Indicators calculated
   - `consensus_calculation`: 9-head consensus calculated
   - `signal_generated`: Signal passed all quality gates

---

## **🔄 COMPLETE WORKFLOW NOW VISIBLE**

### **Step 1: Data Collection** (Every Minute)
```
Binance WebSocket → LiveMarketConnector
  ↓
on_1m_candle() callback
  ↓
✅ Store in database (ohlcv_data table)
✅ Add to indicator calculator buffer
✅ Process through MTF manager (aggregate to 5m, 15m, 1h)
✅ Broadcast: workflow_update (candle_received)
```

### **Step 2: Indicator Calculation** (On Candle Close)
```
Candle closes → on_candle_complete()
  ↓
✅ Calculate 69 indicators from buffer
✅ Broadcast: workflow_update (indicator_calculation)
```

### **Step 3: 9-Head Consensus** (After Indicators)
```
Calculate SDE bias
  ↓
✅ Run all 9 heads:
   - Technical (50+ indicators)
   - Volume (CVD, OBV, VWAP)
   - ICT (OTE, BPR, Judas swings
   - Wyckoff (Phase detection)
   - Harmonic (XABCD patterns)
   - Structure (MTF alignment)
   - Crypto (Alt season, Derivatives)
   - Sentiment (Fallback)
   - Rules (Price action)
  ↓
✅ Count votes (need 5+/9 to agree)
✅ Broadcast: workflow_update (consensus_calculation)
```

### **Step 4: Signal Generation** (If Consensus Achieved)
```
Pass quality gates:
  ✅ 5+ heads agree, 80%+ confidence
  ✅ 70%+ confluence
  ✅ 2.5:1+ R:R
  ✅ Historical validation
  ✅ Regime limits
  ✅ Cooldown window
  ✅ Deduplication
  ↓
✅ Generate signal
✅ Store in database
✅ Broadcast: workflow_update (signal_generated)
✅ Broadcast: new_signal
```

## **📊 MONITORING DASHBOARD**

### **Access**:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (Workflow Monitor panel)
- **API**: http://localhost:8000/api/system/workflow
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:8000/ws (real-time updates)

### **What You Can See**:
1. ✅ **Candles Received**: Count increases every minute per symbol
2. ✅ **Candles Stored**: Should match received (minus duplicates)
3. ✅ **Last Candle Time**: Shows how many seconds ago (should be < 60s)
4. ✅ **Indicator Calculations**: Counts calculations performed
5. ✅ **Consensus Votes**: Shows last 9-head vote breakdown
6. ✅ **Signal Generation**: Shows scans vs signals (rejection rate)

## **🚀 TESTING THE SYSTEM**

### **1. Start Backend**:
```powershell
cd apps\backend
python main.py
```

**Expected Logs**:
```
✓ Loaded historical data for 5 symbols × 4 timeframes
✓ Live market connector started (Binance WebSocket)
💾 Stored new candle: BTCUSDT 1m @ 2025-10-29...
🕯️ Candle closed: BTCUSDT 1m @ 65000
📈 Calculating indicators for BTCUSDT 1m...
🎯 Processing through 9-head consensus for BTCUSDT 1m...
```

### **2. Check API**:
```powershell
# Get workflow status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/workflow

# Get stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/stats
```

### **3. Check Frontend**:
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Scroll to "🔴 Live Workflow Monitor" panel
- Watch for real-time updates every 10 seconds
- Verify candles received increases every minute

---

## **📈 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Every Minute**:
- ✅ New 1m candle received from Binance
- ✅ Candle stored in database
- ✅ Candle added to indicator buffer
- ✅ MTF aggregation updates (if multiples of 5, 15, 60)

### **When Candle Closes** (Every 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h):
- ✅ Indicators calculated (69 indicators)
- ✅ 9-head consensus calculated
- ✅ Quality gates checked
- ✅ Signal generated if all gates pass (rare: 1-2% pass rate)

### **Dashboard Updates**:
- ✅ Workflow status refreshes every 10 seconds via WebSocket
- ✅ Real-time updates on candle events
- ✅ Recent activity log shows last 10 steps

---

## **🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA**

✅ **All Fixed**:
1. New candles stored in database every minute
2. Real-time workflow monitoring visible
3. 9-head consensus votes logged and displayed
4. Complete workflow traceable from candle → signal
5. Dashboard shows live status of all 4 workflow steps

✅ **System Status**:
- Data collection: ✅ Active (every minute)
- Indicator calculation: ✅ Active (on candle close)
- Consensus system: ✅ Active (after indicators)
- Signal generation: ✅ Active (when gates pass)

---

## **🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If candles not being stored**:
1. Check backend logs for database errors
2. Verify database connection in `DB_CONFIG`
3. Check `ohlcv_data` table has unique constraint:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'ohlcv_data';
   ```

### **If workflow monitor not updating**:
1. Check WebSocket connection (green indicator in StatusBar)
2. Open browser DevTools → Network → WS tab
3. Verify `workflow_status` messages received every 10s

### **If no consensus votes visible**:
1. Check logs for "ModelHeadsManager initialized"
2. Wait for candle to close (indicators need data)
3. Check `GET /api/system/workflow` API directly

---

## **📝 NEXT STEPS**

1. ✅ **Monitor for 5-10 minutes** to verify candles arrive every minute
2. ✅ **Watch consensus votes** when candles close
3. ✅ **Check signal generation** (may take hours for high-quality signals)
4. ✅ **Verify database** shows growing `websocket` source count

**System is now fully monitored and data is persisted!** 🎉
