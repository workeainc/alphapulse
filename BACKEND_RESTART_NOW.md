# üî¥ BACKEND RESTART REQUIRED

## Current Situation

- ‚úÖ **Code is correct** - All features are implemented
- ‚ùå **Backend is running OLD code** - Started before latest changes
- ‚ùå **Workflow endpoint missing** - Returns 404 Not Found

---

## Quick Fix (30 seconds)

### **Step 1: Stop Backend**

Find the terminal/PowerShell window where you started the backend and press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **Step 2: Restart Backend**

Open a new terminal and run:

```powershell
cd apps\backend
python main.py
```

### **Step 3: Verify**

Wait 30-60 seconds and look for this message in the logs:
```
‚úì Live market connector started (Binance WebSocket)
Connected to Binance! Streaming 10 data feeds
```

### **Step 4: Check Dashboard**

Refresh your browser (http://localhost:3000) - the error will disappear and you'll see:
- ‚úÖ **LIVE** status badge
- ‚úÖ Candles Received/Stored counters
- ‚úÖ Real-time workflow updates

---

## What Changed That Requires Restart

1. **Database Storage** (NEW) - Lines 493-520
   - Stores every new 1m candle in database
   - Previously only kept in memory

2. **Workflow Monitoring API** (NEW) - Line 681
   - Endpoint: `/api/system/workflow`
   - Returns live status of data collection, indicators, consensus, signals

3. **WebSocket Broadcast** (NEW) - Lines 505-520
   - Sends workflow updates to frontend
   - Real-time status changes

---

## Verification

After restart, test the endpoint:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/workflow
```

Should return JSON with workflow status (not 404).

**The dashboard error will disappear once you restart!** ‚úÖ
