## 🎯 **QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM**

### **The Problem Solved:**
"Checking every 15 minutes = noise and low quality"

### **The Solution:**
**7-Stage Quality Gate System with 98-99% Rejection Rate**

```
Stage 1: SDE Bias Strength → Filters 60%
Stage 2: Confluence Score → Filters 90% of remaining
Stage 3: Risk/Reward → Filters 50% of remaining
Stage 4: Historical Performance → Filters 40% of remaining
Stage 5: Regime Limits → Prevents over-signaling
Stage 6: Cooldown Windows → Time-based spam prevention
Stage 7: Deduplication → One per symbol

Final Pass Rate: 1-2% (98-99% rejected!)
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ Scans: Every 1-60 minutes (adaptive)
- ✅ Signals: 1-3 per day per symbol
- ✅ Quality: 70%+ win rate expected
- ✅ No noise, no spam

---

## 🧠 **ADAPTIVE INTELLIGENCE FEATURES**

### **1. Regime-Based Adaptation**

**System adapts to market conditions:**

| Regime | Analysis TF | Entry TF | Scan Freq | Max Signals | Min Confidence |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| TRENDING | 4h | 1h | 1 hour | 2 | 85% |
| RANGING | 1h | 15m | 15 min | 1 | 90% |
| VOLATILE | 1h | 5m | 5 min | 1 | 92% |
| BREAKOUT | 4h | 15m | 15 min | 3 | 80% |

**Not hardcoded - adapts automatically!**

### **2. Confluence-Based Entries**

**Requires multiple factors to align (70%+):**
- Price Action: 30% (support/resistance)
- Bollinger Bands: 20% (extreme levels)
- Volume: 20% (1.5x+ confirmation)
- MACD: 15% (directional alignment)
- Moving Averages: 15% (key levels)

**Only 3+ confluences = signal**

### **3. Historical Learning**

**Validates against YOUR 1,259 backtest signals:**
- Finds similar historical setups
- Checks win rate (need 60%+)
- Checks profitability (need 3%+)
- Rejects setups that historically failed

**System learns from YOUR own data!**

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### **1. Verify System**
```bash
# Check backend
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check signals
curl http://localhost:8000/api/signals/active

# Check quality stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/stats
```

### **2. Monitor Logs**
Watch backend window for:
```
✓ Candle closed: BTCUSDT 1m @ 85030.0
✓ BTCUSDT: HIGH CONFLUENCE ENTRY FOUND! Score: 0.77
✓ 🎯 HIGH-QUALITY SIGNAL GENERATED
```

Or rejections (normal - 98% of time):
```
✗ ETHUSDT: Low confluence - 0.45
✗ BTCUSDT: Historical win rate only 45%
✗ SOLUSDT: Symbol cooldown
```

### **3. Test Frontend**
- Visit: http://localhost:43000
- See 1-5 quality signals
- Click signal → See SDE consensus
- Watch for entry proximity indicators
